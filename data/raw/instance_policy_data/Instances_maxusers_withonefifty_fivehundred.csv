<h3>Goals </h3>

<p>
The instance has multiple goals, the most important of all being making this instance a nice community with a shared expression space. <br />

As such, we have a few rules we'd like everyone on the instance to follow, which can be found <a href=""https://social.wxcafe.net/terms"">on this page</a>
</p>

<h3>Technical Information</h3>

<p>
This instance is run on a server paid for by <a href=""https://social.wxcafe.net/@wxcafe"">@wxcafe</a>, hosted at <a href=""https://hetzner.com"">Hetzner</a>. This instance is running on a VM on the same server as <a href=""https://imaginair.es"">imaginair.es</a> and <em>is financed using <a href=https://patreon.com/wxcafe>Patreon</a></em> (with the extra coming from <a href=""https://social.wxcafe.net/@wxcafe"">@wxcafe</a>).
</p>

<p>
This instance does not run Genuine Mastodon©️ Software™️, and instead uses the <a href=""https://github.com/glitch-soc/mastodon"">Glitch-soc</a> fork. This allows us to have a lot more features, notably accessiblity tweaks, and work with a more open and helpful development team. As such, I'd like to thank <a href=""https://social.sitedethib.com/@Claire"">Claire</a> for her efforts with the development of both glitch-soc and mainline mastodon, and her precious help with the various problems I have encountered while managing this instance and <a href=""https://imaginair.es"">imaginair.es</a>.

<br/>
You must read and follow our <a href=""/about/more"">server rules</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Mastodon is radically open and decentralized. If you have concerns about your data&#39;s openness, risk, privacy, and security, then it&#39;s important to understand how this platform works. Please ask, and we&#39;ll be happy to go into detail! We will not sell your data, and will make every reasonable attempt to fight coerced disclosure of your data or our logs.<br/>
<br/>
We want this instance to be a pleasant environment for you, while supporting free expression. This is a difficult balance. Although we won&#39;t always succeed, we try both to actively moderate our instance and to be permissive, reasonable, and understanding. Please don&#39;t hesitate to report toots, accounts, or instances to us for moderation.<br/>
<br/>
We federate with most other Mastodon instances. We limit federation (showing their users&#39; content only if you&#39;re following them) with instances that often carry content which our rules would forbid. We block federation with instances that seem to be dedicated to that content.<br/>
<br/>
Our instance hosts many (innocuous) bots. If you don&#39;t want to see their toots, go to the &quot;Filters&quot; section of your preferences and filter the &quot;#bot&quot; hashtag.<br/>
<br/>
Since we&#39;re a small instance and Mastodon is decentralized, our &quot;Local timeline&quot; isn&#39;t as busy as <a href=""https://instances.social/"">larger instances&#39;</a>. Our &quot;Federated timeline&quot; shows toots from any user across the fediverse who is followed by someone here on this instance. Please make interesting posts, and follow interesting people across the fediverse, to make these timelines awesome!<br/>

<p>👋 This server is run by <a href=""https://bne.social/@ash"">Ash</a> and <a href=""https://bne.social/@phocks"">Josh</a>. Please feel free to message us, or email <a href=""mailto:ash@kyd.com.au"">ash@kyd.com.au</a>.</p>

<p>⚖️ This is a moderated instance, in that we don't accept racism, transphobia, or general dickishness, and actively filter out other servers which do. Check out the <a href=""https://bne.social/about/more"">rules</a> for more info and let us know if something is amiss with the report feature.</p>

<h3>SLA & our promise to you</h3>

<p>We will do everything we can to keep the server up and running, but stuff happens and we may need to take the server offline for updates, maintenance or other housekeeping. We'll try to keep outages to a minimum and announce them ahead of time.</p>

<p>Full disclosure, Ash used to run this server back in 2018, but when I moved to Amsterdam a bunch of stuff broke and costs started to spiral so I shut it down. Sorry :/ This time we've got overly powerful dedicated hardware, and two admins to maintain the site so things are more future proof.</p>

<p>Per the <a href=""https://joinmastodon.org/covenant"">Mastodon covenant</a>, we take daily backups and have a recovery plan in place. And if we ever do need to shut the instance down we'll provide 3 months notice for you to export your content and migrate elsewhere.</p>

<p>Note that this is a public server and you shouldn't use it to share private information. If you need to send private messages, we suggest using an encrypted messenger like <a href=""https://signal.org/"">Signal</a>.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, we'd love you to join us! Come say hey :D</p>

<h3>Expanded server rules</h3>

<p>Our server rules are pretty straightforward, but this expanded version goes into detail:</p>

<p><ol>
<li><strong>You must be 18 years or older</strong> to use this site.</li>
<li><strong>No adult content</strong>: including pornography, sexually explicit content, gore, or extremely graphic violence, including artistic depictions.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#39;t punch down</strong>: No content that reinforce or advocate social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion (or lack thereof)</li>
<li><strong>No content harmful to the public good</strong>, such as incitement of violence or promotion of violent ideologies, antivax or climate denial.</li>
<li><strong>No harassment</strong>, dogpiling or doxxing of other users</li>
<li><strong>No content illegal in Australia or Germany</strong></li>
<li><strong>No corporate/brand accounts</strong>. Your art, homemade stuff, and community groups etc are fine. It&#39;s also fine to talk about your work/business from your personal account.</li>

BE WARNED this instance may actually be unstable at times. It will likely be used for experimenting with settings and tweaks to Mastodon. So the place may experience outages, not federate reliably with the rest of the world, have posts go missing, or other technical faults. As such it's meant to be a chill, maybe kinda playful place. Time to see what we can do with this thing! Time to ˥∀IƆOS HƆ⊥I˥⅁
</p>

<p>BE WARNED I (nightpool, the admin) operate this instance according to my own best judgement. I will block other instances,
 suspend users, modify this instance, etc etc as I see fit. SOMETIMES that involves consulting or negotiating with users of this instance, admins of other instances,
 developers that work on the  mastodon code, etc etc. Sometimes it doesn't!
 </p>
<p>followbots from other instances will be blocked. please report them</p>
<p>
Some rules
</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not engage in harassment of any kind.</li>

<li>Racist, sexist and other oppressive slurs will get you suspended, even in non-public conversations.</li>

<li>You can post porn and nudity, but you must use the nsfw flag and do not post on the public timeline or you will be silenced (ask around how to make unlisted posts)</li>

<li>DO NOT post anything publicly that someone else has posted privately (ie. no posting screencaps or quotes of things others said in locked or direct posts!)</li>

<li>try to be kind</li>

<li>no non-sentient bots until further notice</li>

<li>no shit that's illegal in Canada</li>

<li>animated gifs should always be marked sensitive/NSFW and identified as animated gifs (for now let's say just putting 'gif' in the text of the toot is sufficient), because they can cause serious problems for people</li>

</ul>

<p>some guidelines</p>

<ul>
<li>i want this to be as safe a space as we can reasonably make it. let's keep common triggers and angry/ranty/grumpy toots behind CWs</li>
<li>free speech maximalists can kindly fuck off. there are instances where that is a priority. this is not one of them.</li>

<li>all languages are welcome!</li>

</ul>

<p>the privacy stuff in the 'terms' isn't what it should be, but no time to change it yet. this instance's data will not be sold or traded or whatever.</p>

Copyright (C) SQUARE ENIX CO., LTD. All Rights Reserved.",Mastodon for FFXIV Server,,,True
21,58f60733762338151ee6dbb0,sn.angry.im,False,220,"<h3>Disclaimer</h3>

<p>Mastodon is a federated network, which means that content you can view on this instance can originate from other servers. We have absolutely no control over content that we receive from other servers other than after-the-fact deletion. We cannot be held responsible for all content visible on this instance. Any content on this instance do not represent our views in any sense. It is not feasible to review all posted content, local or federated, one-by-one manually. We rely hugely on user reports on content that is illegal / violation of the Rules for moderation.</p>

<p>Media content (video / audio / pictures) on this instance are served from a separate server, different from the one where text-based content (posts, non-picture profile content) are served. Therefore, media content may be subject to different laws than other parts of this instance.</p>

<h3>This Instance</h3>

<p>This instance (<a href=""https://sn.angry.im"">SN.Angry.Im</a>) was created by <a href=""https://sn.angry.im/@PeterCxy"" target=""_blank"">@PeterCxy</a> in 2017, during the rise of the Mastodon project. The admin is committed to maintaining an enjoyable decentralized socialization. Software here are upgraded regularly and the server has active off-site backups of the database. We expect nothing to break very soon.</p>

<p><strong>By registering on this instance, you agree that you have read this page thoroughly, and your behavior on this instance conform to all of our rules listed below, and violations may result in removal of content, suspension or deletion of your account. You agree to give the administrator the absolute authority to interpret and revise the rules at any time in any way he deems suitable, and it is your responsibility to ensure that you are updated and informed with the latest version of the Rules.</strong></p>

<h3>About the Admin</h3>

<p>I am <a href=""https://sn.angry.im/@PeterCxy"" target=""_blank"">@PeterCxy</a>,
 a free-software enthusiast, currently an Undergraduate student.
 I am also a daily Linux / BSD user, and learning to be a sysadmin.</p>

<p>This instance is hosted for personal hobby. It runs on a server located in Europe. The images are stored on a storage cluster spanning Europe and the US.. I also run my personal blog at <a href=""http://typeblog.net"" target=""_blank"">https://typeblog.net</a>.</p>

<h3>Why join SN.Angry.Im</h3>

<p>No particular reason, this is just yet another small Mastodon instance. However, if you love an open community with less limitations and want up-to-date software, then this might be a good choice for you. Nevertheless, you should always read the rules before joining any instance.</p>

<h3>General Policy</h3>

<p>Although these are not rules, this instance follows the general policy listed below. These are used to guide the creation of the Rules, and are of particular importance when dealing with something not covered in the Rules.</p>

<ul>
<li>No enforcement on language / topic / scope of discussion except legality or technical issues.</li>
<li>Do not assume the general identity of people on any particular instance. We recognize that there is no such thing as ""people on instance A are all B"". We try to apply all rules on the account level, not instances.</li>
<li>Block as few instances / accounts as possible. Communicate before blocking.</li>
<li>Enforce as few rules on speech as legally possible.</li>
<li>Do not block foreign instances just because of speech, except illegal ones.</li>
<li>Do not block accounts / instances due to political / ideological conflicts.</li>
<li>Prioritize removal of violating content over silencing and suspension. Only silence / suspend when necessary (e.g. accounts dedicated to illegal content).</li>
<li>Enforce no more rules of our own than necessary to foreign instances that we federate with. i.e. Do not moderate content on other instances according to our own rules except those explicitly marked as applicable to federated content.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rules</h3>

<p>Rules marked with a (*) are applicable to federated content.</p>

<ul>
<li>Content visible from this instance may originate either from this instance or from the Fediverse, which consists of thousands of other servers running software compatible with the ActivityPub protocol. Such content do not represent views or ideas of this instance and its moderators in any sense. We do not agree with everyone that are visible from this instance. <strong>We are not responsible for speech and media visible on this instance, whether it is local or remote.</strong> We can only moderate on our own server according to our own rules, but we are not able to control the entire Fediverse. Even if a server is silenced or blocked from this server, it still exists and may still be visible from other servers.</li>
<li><strong>Accounts on this instance shall not block the administrator and/or moderators completely</strong>. At the very least, Direct Messages from the administrator shall be receivable to every user on this instance. This is to ensure that important server notices and policy updates can be made available as soon as possible to each user. After all, if you do not trust the administrator of this instance, you should probably not register here in the first place.</li>
<li>NSFW (Not-Safe-For-Work) content, in addition to rules listed in this section, are subject to rules separately listed in ""Rules for NSFW Content"". (*)</li>
<li>Account / instance bans do not propagate through interaction. If person A interacted with person B (boosted / replied etc.), and person B gets banned from this instance, person A may not be subject to the same punishment, unless A is also dedicated to the same purpose as B. However, any content that relates to person B will be removed from this instance upon banning, including all these interactions. When reporting content, we kindly ask you to always report the original account that posted the offending content. (*)</li>
<li>Illegal content will be removed and the offending account may be subject to suspension depending on severity. We respond to complaints on illegal contents as fast as possible. Be aware that this server is currently located in Finland, the database being in Germany, and the media server (server that handles user-uploaded pictures, videos, etc.; such content is <strong>not</strong> served from the main server) spans both Europe and the US, and the administrator, a citizen of China, is currently located physically in Canada. Laws from these regions can apply here, <strong>even if said law is not listed as one of the rules here</strong>. We try to make our rules according to applicable laws, but since we are not lawyers, if any of the rules here conflict with an applicable law, <strong>the law overrides all the rules listed here</strong>.</li>
<li>Illegal content from other instances will be removed from this instance. The offending account may be silenced or suspended according to legal requests. The moderators of the offending instance shall be contacted after the matter, and if the laws that caused the matter applicable to the offending instance and this instance are incompatible, said instance should be blocked from this instance. (*)</li>
<li>Actions from the administrator and moderator accounts, including but not limited to silencing and blocking, do not imply policy of this instance. An account can get blocked from the moderators, but not from the entire instance unless they do not conform to our rules that apply to federated content.</li>
<li>Hate speech, whether targeting a certain race, ethnicity, sex, or any group of people, will result in the <strong>account</strong> being silenced from the public timeline of this server. If such speech is deemed illegal (e.g. Nazi ideology), said account will be subject to suspension. (*)</li>
<li>Accounts that intentionally flood either the timeline or others' inbox are subject to suspension.</li>
<li>Accounts from other instances that cause flooding on this instance are subject to silencing or suspension. If more than 2 accounts on one foreign instance have been blocked for this reason and the moderator of said instance do not take any action against flooding, said instance may be blocked from this instance. (*)</li>
<li>We recommend against political discussion that causes harassment and general discomfort on this instance. Despite the name of the instance, we recommend you keep calm and polite to people that you do not agree with. Depending on the frequency and severity, accounts that are dedicated to such content may be silenced from the public timeline. If said speech contain illegal content, the account will then be suspended. Also, remember that people can simply block you even if there is no instance-level punishment.</li>
<li>Accounts on this instance, with the sole purpose of commercial promotion, can be silenced from the public timeline.</li>
<li>Accounts on this instance, that are controlled by a piece of program (i.e. bot accounts), are subject to case-by-case handling. Bots that increase the load of the server substantially, or cause spamming / breaking any of the rules, will be suspended.</li>
<li>Content that violate copyright will be removed upon request.</li>
<li>Accounts on this instance, that use a symbol of another person's account that is clearly part of said person's online identity (clearly personal usernames / avatars), whether the other account is on this instance, on some other instance in the Fediverse, or on another platform entirely, with the intention to mock or harass said person, will be suspended.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rules for NSFW Content</h3>

<p>All rules below, except when explicitly exempted, are equally applicable to local and federated content.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>This instance is not focused on NSFW content. Before creating your NSFW account on this instance, please be kindly informed that there are better instances out there for such content. We do not disallow, but also do not welcome such content to originate from our instance.</strong></li>
<li>All NSFW content other than those explicitly allowed in this section is disallowed from this instance, local or remote. Local offenders will be subject to content removal and/or account suspension, while remote offenders will be blocked individually or domain-blocked as full instances with local cached content removed.</li>
<li>Any NSFW content with regards to / depicting / alluding to minors will be removed and the account who posted the content will be suspended immediately.</li>
<li>Any NSFW content in violation of applicable laws will be removed, regardless of whether it is covered in this section or above.</li>
<li>All rules for general content on this instance apply to NSFW content <strong>before</strong> any rule in this section.</li>
<li>We shall not be held responsible for any federated NSFW content that do not originate from this instance. We can moderate and remove them from this instance, but they still live in the Fediverse. If you would like some NSFW content to be permanently removed, please contact the instance where the content originated from.</li>
<li>It is up to the moderators to decide whether a piece of content is deemed unsuitable for publication on this instance, including but not limited to the definition of different types of NSFW content.</li>
<li>Content that contain sexual cues but are not explicitly pornography (i.e. do not involve actual sexual depiction and/or nudity) is also considered ""mildly NSFW"", and is allowed but we recommend Content Warning to be enabled nevertheless.</li>
<li>Mild NSFW content is allowed on this instance, except when the rules and/or applicable laws explicitly disallows said content.</li>
<li>Content Warning (CW) shall be enabled on all NSFW content. Failing to do so will result in said content being removed from public timeline, and repeated offender accounts may be subject to suspension. Foreign instances that do not enforce similar policies may be silenced, suspended or media-blocked from this instance.</li>
<li>NSFW media content (pictures / video / audio) originating from this instance, with sexual depiction and/or nudity, that involve acting of a real person, for the sole purpose of pornography (i.e. without artistic value), will be removed, and repeated offenders will be subject to suspension. Federated content that violate this specific rule will be handled in a case-by-case manner.</li>

<p>ただしアカウントを作れるのは、かわいい感じのケモノ風のキャラクターや、頭身低めのマスコット的なキャラクターが嫌いじゃない方だけです。単にそういう気持ちを持っているかどうかが条件なので、そればかりを話題にする必要はありません。「ケモノ」の範囲は大まかに広く取っています。トリもトカゲもサメも大丈夫です。ただケモミミの生えたヒトは該当しません。「頭身低めのマスコット的なキャラクター」にはいわゆる「TDM」を含みます。</p>

<p>このサーバー内の最近の公開投稿（会話以外）を覗いてみるには、メニューの <a href=""/public/local""><span class=""fa fa-fw fa-globe""></span> リアルタイムフィード</a>をご覧ください。その画面で「ほかのサーバー」に切り替えると、サーバー内の人が受信している他サーバーからの投稿も表示されます。</p>

<p>アカウントを作ってログインしたら、気になるアカウントをフォローして、自分専用のタイムラインを作りましょう。「もふけもの。」の中だけではなく、ほかのマストドンサーバーや、Misskey などにいる人々とも交流できます。</p>

<p>「ケモノ風のキャラクター」や「マスコット的なキャラクター」の話題を集めるハッシュタグとして「<a href=""/tags/%E3%82%82%E3%81%B5%E3%81%91%E3%82%82%E3%81%AE"">#もふけもの</a>」を推奨しています。それっぽい話には積極的に付けてください！（もちろん付けないのも自由です。）ハッシュタグをフォローすれば、タグ付き投稿がホームにも現れます。</p>

<h1>そもそもマストドンって？</h1>

<p>「もふけもの。」は<a href=""https://joinmastodon.org""><strong>マストドン</strong></a>（Mastodon）で動作するサーバーの一つです。マストドンとは、短い文章を投稿したり、ほかの人の投稿を時系列順に読んだりできる、ツイッターに似た機能を持つサーバーソフトウェアです。</p>

<p>マストドンのサーバーは世界中にあり、それぞれ独立して運営されていますが、共通の通信方式（ActivityPub）で互いにやり取りしています。そのおかげで、異なるサーバーにいる人同士でも互いにフォローして投稿を読んだり、会話したりすることができます。同じ方式で通信するソフトウェアはマストドン以外に「Pleroma」や「Misskey」などもあり、それらで動作するサーバーとも結びついています。こうした連合全体を「分散型ソーシャルネットワーク」などと呼んだりします。</p>

<p>各サーバーは規模も、運営方針も、雰囲気もさまざまです。内部で会話することを重視するサーバーもあれば、ほかのサーバーの人をフォローしに行くことが主眼のサーバーもあります。自分の使い方に合ったサーバーを探してみてください。（複数のサーバーにアカウントを作っても問題ないですし、フォロワーを引き継いで別サーバーに引っ越す機能があるので、「合わないな」と感じたら移転する手はあります。）</p>

<p>「もふけもの。」は規模が小さいので、小さなコミュニティーのような雰囲気を持っていますが、そこでの話題に参加する義務はありません。好きなことを一人でつぶやいたり、ほかのサーバーの人とやり取りしたりと、自由にネットワークを利用する拠点として使えます。</p>

<h1>サーバーのホストについて</h1>

<p>「もふけもの。」はマストドンサーバーのホスティングサービスである <a href=""https://masto.host/""><strong>Masto.host</strong></a> を利用していて、物理的なデータセンターはフランスに設置されています。このため、サーバー内の運営・管理は Masto.host の方針と現地の法律に配慮することになります。また、「もふけもの。」にアカウントを作る時などは <code>mofu.kemo.no</code> ではなく <code>masto.host</code> のドメインからメールが届くようになっているので、ご留意ください。</p>

<h1>電気通信事業法における位置づけ</h1>

<p>「もふけもの。」は利益を目的としないサービスです。利用者は無償で利用でき、広告収入なども得ていません。したがって「電気通信事業を営む者」に当たらず、届出を要しません。（総務省の<a href=""https://www.soumu.go.jp/menu_kyotsuu/important/kinkyu02_000495.html"">電気通信事業参入マニュアル・追補版</a>による）</p>

<h1>維持・運営費について</h1>

<p>当サーバーは Masto.host の Star プランを利用していて、一ヶ月当たりの費用（ホスティング代）は日本円換算で 3000 円ほどです。基本的にオーナーのだいちゃん <a href=""/@daibaka"">@daibaka</a> がすべて負担しています。毎月、オーナーのアカウントで収支を報告します。</p>

<p>費用の一部をまかなう任意のご支援を受け付けています。「ちょコム送金」というサービスを利用して、クレジットカード（VISA・マスターカード）でオーナーへ送金できます。カード会社の本人認証サービス（3Dセキュア）の手続きが必要です。</p>

<p>送金の際は<a href=""https://soukin.chocom.jp/user/""><strong>ちょコム送金</strong></a>のページで、次のように入力してください。</p>

<ul>
<li>送金先メールアドレス : <strong>info@kemo.no</strong></li>
<li>送金目的 : <strong>寄付・募金</strong></li>
<li>メッセージ : ご希望の表示名（掲載を望まれる場合）</li>

<p>We&#39;re a public Mastodon instance hosted and maintained by the Academic Computer Club in Umeå, Northern Sweden. </p>

<p>We hope you&#39;ll be happy here, but if you find it&#39;s not for you, there are many <a href=""https://joinmastodon.org/"">other instances</a> to choose from.</p>

</ul>

<hr>

<h2>General Use</h2>

<p>When using <em>mastodon.acc.sunet.se</em>, we ask that you comply with the established rules and usage policy of the Academic Computer Club (ACC) (available <a href=""http://www.accum.se/information/policy.html.en"">in English</a> and <a href=""http://www.accum.se/information/policy.html.sv"">i Svenska</a>) and of <a href=""https://www.sunet.se/om-sunet/policy-etiska-regler"">SUNET</a>.</p>

<p>We welcome language diversity, and support the right of users to post in the language of their choosing.</p>

<p>Accounts on <em>mastodon.acc.sunet.se</em> are for personal use. Please see the <a href=""#you-may-not-use-services-hosted-by-acc-for-commercial-purposes"">code of conduct</a> if you need clarification on personal vs. commercial use.</p>

<p>You may not post (or boost/repost):</p>

<ul>
<li> material illegal under Swedish law,</li>
<li> material in breach of Swedish or EU copyright laws,</li>
<li> material that may damage ACC&#39;s public image or its relationship with authorities or other institutions.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is up to ACC to make the final determination what material violates our usage policy or may damage our public relations and to take suitable action, which may include removal of the material and suspension of your account.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>This code is not all inclusive, and you shouldn&#39;t assume something not explicitly prohibited is acceptable. When in doubt, err on the side of empathy, civility, and kindness.</p>

<h4>Taking part in online interaction obliges the user to abide by current rules and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netiquette"">netiquette</a>.</h4>

<p>On Mastodon, this includes using the <strong>CW</strong> function and the <strong>#NSFW</strong> hashtag, and choosing an appropriate level of public display for your posts. We  encourage our users to add alt text to their images to make our instance more inclusive for people with visual impairment.</p>

<p>Media that contains violent or explicit imagery, or that could reasonably be assumed to be upsetting to an average person, should always be marked as sensitive.</p>

<h4>Be considerate of other people.</h4>

<p>Please remember what you say on <em>mastodon.acc.sunet.se</em> is public and can be seen by any person on the internet, many of whom have backgrounds and values that differ from yours; take a moment before posting and think about ways your message might be misunderstood. Likewise, remember that many things you read may be written by people with different values or from different backgrounds than yourself, and they might not have understood how their message could be read in a negative way.</p>

<p>Racism, sexism, and hateful messages about sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, disability, or any cultural, ethnic, caste, or religious identity or background are absolutely prohibited. </p>

<h4>You may not use services hosted by ACC to violate another person&#39;s integrity.</h4>

<p>This includes compiling and posting personal information about another person (&quot;doxxing&quot;), posting personal communications from a person without their permission, sending harassing or abusive messages, or coordinating harassment against other people (&quot;dogpiling&quot;).</p>

<h4>Bot accounts and accounts that use excessive automated posting may be suspended or silenced if they&#39;re disruptive or degrade performance.</h4>

<p>Please be considerate when programming your bots or using automatic posting services or applications, and use rate limiting and unlisted post visibility. You may also want to consider hosting your bot on a bot-friendly instance like <a href=""https://botsin.space/"">botsin.space</a>. </p>

<p>Uncurated autoposters and newsbots posting from feed sources are not permitted.</p>

<h4>You may not use services hosted by ACC for commercial purposes.</h4>

<p>There&#39;s not always a clear line between personal and commercial activity, especially for people who work on a freelance basis in creative and technical fields. If your account is for personal social interaction with other people, even if you&#39;re talking to people who work in your industry or sharing the kind of work you also do professionally, it&#39;s probably fine.</p>

<p>If your primary use for a Mastodon account is to advertise your products or services, post affiliate links, build your brand, connect with customers, or grow your audience, it&#39;s probably a commercial account and not allowed on <em>mastodon.acc.sunet.se</em>. If you need Mastodon for your business, why not <a href=""https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon"">run your own</a>? :)</p>

<h4>If you see content which you believe is in breach of this code or our usage rules, please report it for review.</h4>

<p>If you&#39;re unsure whether something is a violation of our policies, but it feels questionable, please do report it. We&#39;ll review it before taking any action.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Reporting an Issue</h2>

<p>For technical issues, use the administrator contact information listed under &quot;Contact&quot;</p>

<p>For content or abuse issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you&#39;re a user on <em>mastodon.acc.sunet.se</em> you can use the &quot;Report&quot; function on the post you would like to report;</li>
<li>if you&#39;re not a user on <em>mastodon.acc.sunet.se</em>, you may report the post from your server and choose to send us an anonymised copy.</li>
<li>if you&#39;re an administrator of another server who would like to discuss a report you received about one of our users, please use the administrator email listed under &quot;Contact&quot;. </li>
</ul>

<p>For privacy reasons, we do not discuss abuse reports in public channels.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Privacy</h2>

<p>ACC does its best to respect the privacy of individual users, but please remember that nothing on the internet is really private and consider that anything you publish may be available forever.</p>

<p>Mastodon is not a secure channel for sensitive communication.</p>

<p>In accordance with ACC policy, staff may examine user accounts hosted on the association&#39;s equipment if they suspect activity that conflicts with the association&#39;s rules.</p>

<p>We abide by the standard Mastodon privacy policy and our copy is located <a href=""https://mastodon.acc.sunet.se/terms"">here</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Federation Policy</h2>

<p><em>mastodon.acc.sunet.se</em> values the ability of its users to connect with other people across the federation and will do its utmost to preserve that connectivity. By default this instance federates with all other Mastodon and Mastodon-compatible instances in the network. </p>

<p>Federation limitations such as silencing or media rejection may be used when content from another server conflicts with what&#39;s allowed on our server. This is usually due to incompatibility between contant allowed on our instance and content allowed on theirs. You&#39;re still able to follow and communicate with users on a silenced instance, but their posts will not appear in the public timelines on <em>mastodon.acc.sunet.se</em>. Please exercise discretion when boosting posts from these instances.</p>

<p>Full federation suspension is only implemented in cases of network-disrupting technical difficulties, or hostile or malicious activity. </p>

<p>Currently, federation limitations or suspensions are made on a case by case basis and we do not employ any third party blocklists.</p>

<p>A full list of instances with which we limit or suspend federation may found below under <strong>Moderated servers</strong>.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re the admin of a server on the list, you can reach us via our contact email to let us know when your situation is resolved and it&#39;s safe to restore connection.</p>

<li>Não listada: A publicação é enviada para todos os seguidores, aparece na página pública de perfil da pessoa que postou, não aparece em buscas por hashtags.</li>

<p>Caso a sua denúncia seja relativa a um dos moderadores, você pode reportar a violação através de mensagem direta à um dos outros moderadores.</p>
<p>Você pode fazer uma denúncia mesmo que a sua situação não seja diretamente coberta por essas regras, caso a situação lhe cause desconforto. A moderação irá avaliar cada situação individualmente.</p>

<p><a name=""privacy""></a>
In Mastodon each status can be posted with one of three different audience configurations. It&#39;s important to have that in mind because certain rules apply only to one or other configuration:</p>

<ul>
<li>Followers-only: The toot is sent to all followers, but does not appear in the public profile page of the person that posted it, nor does it appear in hashtag searches.</li>
<li>Unlisted: The toot is sent to all followers, appear in the public profile page of the person that posted it, but does not appear in hashtag searches.</li>
<li>Public: The toot is sent to the &quot;local&quot; and &quot;federated&quot; timelines (which are shared by other members of the instance), is sent to all followers, appears in the public profile page of the person that posted it and appears in hashtag searches.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id=""on-crossposters"">On Crossposters</h3>

<p>Crossposters are tools, automated or otherwise, used to post from other networks (such as Twitter or Tumblr) into Mastodon. The use of such tools is allowed, but the following rules apply:</p>

<ol>
<li>Retweets, quotes (retweets with comments) or reblogs <strong>cannot</strong> be posted with the &quot;Public&quot; privacy setting.</li>
<li>Posts coming from other networks, such as Twitter, still need to obey to the other rules described in this code of conduct, such as the content warning policy.</li>
<li>Crossposters can only be used with the condition that you follow your notifications, otherwise they will result in suspension after a first warning.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id=""how-to-report-a-code-of-conduct-violation"">How to report a code of conduct violation</h3>

<p>Mastodon has tools for reporting toots and profiles. Any toot or profile you believe that&#39;s violating a rule of this code can be reported using the reporting tools and it will be sent to all moderators.</p>

<p>If your report is relative to one of the moderators, you can report the violation through direct message to one of the other moderators.</p>

<p>You can report a toot or profile even if the situation is not described directly in these rules, if the situation cause you discomfort. The moderation team will evaluate each case individually.</p>

<p>We will respond in a private manner to all reports we receive, making an effort that the first response is given in the first 24 hours.</p>

<p>
<ol><li>forgetting to tag politics</li>
<li>being a nazi</li>
<li>dragons being jerks to mammals (or to each other, but especially to the mammals)</li>
<li>also non-dragons being jerks to anyone, just don&#39;t be a jerk, okay?</li>
<li>also please be aware that @anthracite only speaks English and may thus be a lot less nuanced in her use of the banhammer if you&#39;re being a jerk to someone in another language</li>
<li>doxxing, brigading, death threats, all that 4chan/ljdrama/kiwifarms edgelord shit</li>
<li>posting nsfw stuff (especially Actual Human Nakeds)without a content warning</li>

<li>questioning @anthracite&#39;s moderation/federation decisions, especially if you use the terms &quot;virtue signalling&quot; or &quot;filter bubble&quot; whilst doing so</li>
<li>posting AI-generated art, it is okay if there is some buried deep in your art process but if you are a &quot;prompt engineer&quot; who spends 90% of their time on a piece typing stuff into a text input box then you are not welcome here</li>
<li>giving @anthracite cause to expand the list of actions that are explicitly forbidden here</li></ol>

<h1>TL;DR</h1>
<p>Imagine you have a cool queer trans aunt who is a cartoon dragon sometimes. Don&#39;t do anything that&#39;d probably piss her off.
<p>Also, we generally silence any instance that claims to be dedicated to &quot;free speech&quot;, as in practice this usually means it is happy to host hate speech. Life&#39;s too short for that shit.
<hr></p>

<h1>SOMETHING LIKE TERMS OF SERVICE:</h1>

<p><p>
This is an experiment. We currently make no promises as to the safety of any data you post to this site, nor to its persistence. Shit happens.
<p>
We do, however, promise not to try to monetize your attention with advertisements. We also promise not to share your private data with any other people, government agencies, or corporate entities. Well, we might share your data if the government comes knocking with a big pile of lawyers. We haven&#39;t had that happen yet.
<p>
We also don&#39;t want to dig into your private messages. That said, if someone is claiming you&#39;re harassing them in PMs, we will have a look at them. Please try not to make us have to look.  Also,  keep in mind that private messages are <em>not</em> encrypted, and other servers are <em>not</em> guaranteed to respect the &#39;this is private&#39; marker. I would not advise talking about anything illegal here until the Mastodon project solves this.
<p>
It&#39;s up to you if you trust us to keep these promises. &quot;We&quot; is currently just @anthracite, a trans lady in her mid-forties.
<hr>
<h3>&quot;IF YOU&#39;RE NOT PAYING FOR IT, YOU&#39;RE THE PRODUCT&quot;</h3>
<p>The whole model of commercial social networks has been &quot;make money by selling your attention to advertisers, as increasingly-more-specific market segments&quot;. This has a lot of problems.
<p>
Right now, running this thing costs me about $27/month, which is pocket change for me. But if you&#39;d like to help out then I&#39;ve set up <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/dragondotstyle"">a Patreon</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively: make crazy porn of <a href=""https://www.furaffinity.net/gallery/egypturnash/folder/199712/Model-sheets"">one of my fursonas</a> happen (with or without your fursona, check out my FA faves to see if our impossible fantasy kinks overlap), or make a donation to the <a href=""https://www.splcenter.org"">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> or your local chapter of the <a href=""http://www.dsausa.org"">Democratic Socialist Party</a>. Or just take some spare money out of the bank and give it to someone near you who needs it more than either of us. &hearts;</p>

<p>Also you can just throw some money at me via <a href=""https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/egypturnash"">Paypal</a> or <a href=""https://ko-fi.com/egypturnash"">Ko-fi</a>. Whatever. None of this is mandatory but it is certainly appreciated.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liner_notes"">Liner notes</a> are the printed text and graphical content often added to the packaging of musical recordings. Sometimes they contain little more than the list of songs and the people involved with recording them. Other times they contain fantastic inside looks at the recording process for an album, the song lyrics, critical reviews of the recording, mixed media explorations of the music&#39;s themes and content, and more.</p>

<p><a href=""https://linernotes.club"">Liner Notes Club</a> is a Mastodon instance dedicated to providing fans of music with a place to socialize and share their love of making and listening to music.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a Mastodon instance without a strong local theme, we recommend exploring other options using the tools at <a href=""https://instances.social/"">https://instances.social/</a>.</p>

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF USE, PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS THE CLUB.</p>

<h2>Governing Law</h2>

<h2>Age Restrictions</h2>

<p>Registration and participation on the Club is restricted to those individuals over 18 years of age, emancipated minors, or those who possess legal parental or guardian consent, and are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations and warranties herein. By registering or participating in services or functions of the Club, you hereby represent that you are over 18 years of age, an emancipated minor or in possession of consent by a legal parent or guardian and have the authority to enter into the terms herein. In any case, you affirm that you are over the age of 13 as the Club is not intended for children under 13, per the requirement of COPPA (Children&#39;s Online Privacy Proteciton Act). If you are under 13 years of age, do not use the Club. In addition, those who wish to register and participate must meet the minimum requirements laid out in the Terms of Use (this document) herein. If you do not qualify or do not agree to these terms, you may not use the Club.</p>

<h2>Right of Modification</h2>

<p>We reserve the right to change or modify the Terms of Use, including the Code of Conduct and Server Rules, at our sole discretion at any time. Any change or modification to the Terms of Use will be effective immediately upon posting by us. For any material changes to the Terms, we will take reasonable steps to notify you of such changes. In all cases, your continued use of the Club after publication of such modifications, with or without notification, constitutes acceptance of these modified Terms of Use.</p>

<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>Music is universal. Music unites across all cultural, linguistic, and ideological differences; <a href=""https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/11/new-harvard-study-establishes-music-is-universal/"">we are one nation under a groove</a>. What moves you? What gets your body twitching, your head nodding, your jaw hanging open in disbelief? What inspires you to create? We created the Club to celebrate the joy of experiencing music in whatever form your experience takes.</p>

<p>Whoever you are, wherever you are, if you love music, you are welcome here. Please help us ensure that <em>everyone</em> is welcome, by following these guidelines. This is not an exhaustive list of what we can and cannot do on linernotes.club. Take it in the spirit in which it is intended -- a guide to make it easier for everyone to participate in this community.</p>

<p>This code of conduct applies to all users of the Club, including its administrators and moderators. Violation of this Code may result in suspension from the Club. Additionally, violation of this code outside the Club may result in user suspensions, instance silencing or blocking (defederation).</p>

<h2>1. General Guidelines</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Be welcoming</strong>. We strive to be a community that welcomes people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, religion, neurodiversity, and physical ability.</li>
<li><strong>Be respectful</strong>. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. Members of the Club should be respectful of each other and of other users in the Fediverse.</li>
<li><strong>Choose your words with care.</strong> Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others or belittle their experiences.</li>
<li><strong>Make it easy for others to moderate their experience</strong>. Liberally use Content Warnings, hashtags, and unlisted/&quot;Followers Only&quot; posts so others can choose whether to engage with your content.</li>
<li><strong>De-escalate</strong>. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop. Avoid microaggressions such as &quot;not all men,&quot; white/man/cis-splaining, knowingly using the wrong pronouns to address someone, posting about particular individuals without naming them (&quot;subtooting&quot;), and so on. If you make a mistake, apologize.</li>
<li><strong>No Gate-Keeping</strong>. We love all kinds of music in the Club, including much that you may not love. Accept and celebrate that <em>we</em> love it.</li>
<li><strong>Be friendly</strong>. Don&#39;t be a dick.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Content Guidelines</h2>

<h2>2.1 Examples of On-Topic Content</h2>

<li>Content that plants malware or otherwise uses the Club to distribute malware</li>
</ul>

<p>Users are permitted to discuss depictions of these topics as they appear in media, provided they are treated as <em>Sensitive Content</em>; see section 2.3.</p>

<p>Content Warnings are not expected on posts made by historically or socially marginalised people about their own marginalisation.</p>

<h2>2.5 Accesibility</h2>

</ul>

<h2>3.3 External Use</h2>

<h3>3.3.1 Crawling, Indexing, and Archiving</h3>

<p>Crawling https://linernotes.club to gather information about posts, post metadata, media, or other content hosted on the Club is prohibited for any purpose, including but not limited to analysis, creating databases, search indexes, or archives.</p>

<h3>3.3.2 Federation</h3>

<p>Federating with the Club is not guaranteed. Links between federated instances are temporary and may change or disappear at any time. The Administrators of the Club and their delegates determine which instances the Club will federate with and which are silenced, blocked, or suspended.</p>

<h1>4. Copyright</h1>

<p>Public toots are derived works that are protected by copyright.</p>

<p>All original content is copyrighted by the author and cannot be distributed or used without prior permission by the author. Do not repost or disseminate our users&#39; original content anywhere without their express permission.</p>

<h1>5. Moderation</h1>

<p>The Club&#39;s administrators and their delegates will summarily and with prejudice suspend or terminate users who violate the Club&#39;s Terms of Service, and silence or block (defederate from) instances enabling those users. You may comport yourself however you wish; we are not required to provide you a platform to do so.</p>

<p>If you believe someone is violating Code of Conduct, we ask that you submit a report when you block the user or instance. Provide as much detail as is necessary for the Club&#39;s Moderation Team to have the context required to fully investigate the issue.</p>

<p>If you are reporting a user on an instance other than Liner Notes Club, please be sure to forward the report to the user&#39;s instance also.</p>

<h2>5.1 Our Responsibilities</h2>

<p>The Administrators and Moderation Team will endeavour to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lead by example, abiding by the Terms of Use.</li>
<li>Keep the atmosphere of the Club as welcoming and enjoyable as possible.</li>
<li>Keep the Club online and functional for as long as possible.</li>
<li>Clarify the standards of acceptable behaviour.</li>
<li>Enforcing the Terms of Use with appropriate corrective actions when users are found to be in violation.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will not act on complaints regarding:</p>

<ul>
<li>Good-faith criticism such as &quot;This is sexist,&quot; &quot;That comes off as tone deaf,&quot; &quot;This comment offends me,&quot; and so on. Instead of reporting this kind of feedback, engage with it, apologize, or agree to disagree and move on.</li>
<li>Swearing or profanity. Use filters or mute/block users whose language you don&#39;t enjoy.</li>
<li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as &quot;leave me alone,&quot; &quot;go away,&quot; or &quot;I’m not discussing this with you&quot;.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5.2 Corrective Actions</h2>

<p>The following are some examples of corrective actions the Moderation Team may enact in specific situations. <strong>These are examples only and meant to illustrate our general approach to moderation</strong>. Each incident of reported unacceptable behaviour will be handled on its own merits.</p>

<p><strong>If you are a Club member and violate our Terms of Use</strong>, we will: </p>

<ul>
<li>suspend your account;</li>
<li>inform you via email of the suspension and the reasons for it; and</li>
<li>explain what you need to do to be reinstated, such as apologize to affected parties or agree not to continue posting <em>Prohibited Content</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If you are a user of a federated instance and harass one of our members</strong>, we will:</p>

<ul>
<li>suspend your account; and</li>
<li>inform your instance&#39;s Moderation Team.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If another instance fails to actively moderate the posting of <em>Prohibited Content</em> via weak moderation</strong>, we will:</p>

<ul>
<li>silence the instance</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If another instance explicitly or implicitly enables the posting of <em>Prohibited Content</em> or enables harassment, trolling, doxxing, and so on</strong>, we will:</p>

<ul>
<li>block (defederate from) the instance</li>
</ul>

<h2>5.3 Accountability</h2>

<h3>5.3.1 Moderation Decisions</h3>

<p>Moderated servers -- that is, instances that are silenced or blocked by us -- will be posted to https://linernotes.club/about.</p>

<p>Changes to the moderated servers list will be posted using the #LinerNotesAdmin hashtag by one of the Moderation Team.</p>

<h3>5.3.2 Appeals</h3>

<p>If you believe the Moderation Team has made an error in judgement or the corrective action(s) we have taken are inappropriate, please contact us. The Moderation Team acts in good faith and strives to always act fairly, but we will make mistakes and when we do we will embrace those mistakes and learn from them.</p>

<p>In the event of a dispute, the Administrators may override the Moderation Team; their judgment is final.</p>

<h3>5.3.3 Requests for Clarification</h3>

<p>If you require clarification of these Terms of Use, or are unsure how to handle a potential violation of these Terms, please message the Moderation Team directly on Mastodon.</p>

<h3>5.3.4 Changes to the Terms of Use</h3>

<p>The Administrators and Moderation Team will occasionally update these Terms of Use as necessary. Minor updates such as edits for clarity or changes in Moderation Team membership will be posted using the #LinerNotesAdmin hashtag by one of the Administators. Significant changes to policy, such as changes to the Code of Conduct, will be drafted and made available for review and feedback by Club users for at least 5 days. </p>

",The premiere Fediverse destination for music lovers who nod knowingly at each other from across the room when that song comes on.,Liner Notes Club,,,True
73,5ac7aed05a17ff0254521d90,pipou.academy,False,242,"<h3 id=""Bienvenue""> Bienvenue !</h3>

<p><br>Nous sommes un établissement de langue principalement française (anglais également accueilli) ouvert à tous les élèves pipou.
<br>Qu’est-ce qu’un.e pipou ? Vaste et scientifique question qui n’a qu’une réponse : l’élève pipou est une personne gentille ou qui vise à l’être.<br><br></p>

<p><em>Les valeurs de notre académie :</em><br>
-  L’académie Pipou prône la bienveillance. Nous visons à créer un espace aussi accueillant que possible, où chaque élève se sentira à l’aise et saura qu’iel peut être ellui-même (tant que « ellui-même » n’est pas « un.e vil.e vilain.e »).<br>
-  Nous accueillons toutes les lettres du sigle LGBT+ et les alliés. Les personnes de toutes origines, opinions et orientations sont les bienvenues dans notre établissement, tant qu’elles s’efforcent de suivre notre règlement !<br><br></p>

<h3 id=""Qui""> Qui sommes nous ?</h3>

<p><br>Je me dois d&#39;être honnête : on est une petite instance, et j&#39;ai la modération lourde. Ça veut dire que le fil local n&#39;est pas très animé, et que si vous êtes relativement à l&#39;abri de &quot;reply guys&quot; (les gens qui viennent répondre de manière désagréable pour se sentir très intelligents), ça risque aussi de vous couper d&#39;un certain nombre d&#39;interactions spontanées. Mon but premier, c&#39;est d&#39;offrir un choix d&#39;instance parmi d&#39;autres, et de garantir un niveau de modération. 
<br>N&#39;hésitez pas à faire un compte pour vous faire un avis, si vous restez c&#39;est cool, si vous partez c&#39;est ok aussi. Les inscriptions sont semi-ouvertes, c&#39;est à dire qu&#39;il faut m&#39;écrire un petit mot pour que je les valide. C&#39;est pour éviter une invasion de spam-bots. Pas besoin de m&#39;écrire un roman, juste de quoi me rassurer sur votre humanité.</p>

<p><br><br>Du coup, qui est l&#39;admin ? Une personne blanche, agenre, féministe et queer. J&#39;ai certainement des angles morts et je veux qu&#39;on me les pointe. Je suis dispo pour parler modération, et j&#39;accepte aussi les demandes de rajouts d&#39;emojo.<br><br></p>

<h3 id=""règles"">Règlement détaillé de l'académie</h3>

<p><em>Article 1 dit « De la simple décence »</em> <br>
-  Pas de propos racistes, sexistes, homophobes, transphobes, antisémites, xénophobes, grossophobes, validistes.<br>
-  Pas d’attaques envers vos camarades. Les insultes, le harcèlement, les « chasses aux sorcières » contre des types d’élèves ne sont pas tolérées au sein de notre établissement.<br><br></p>

<p><em>Article 2 dit « De la bienveillance »</em> <br>
-  Pas de justice personnelle. Si vous tombez sur des profils de « trolls » ou d’élèves qui enfreignent l’article 1, ne répondez pas et signalez la personne au système ou à un.e administrateur.ice.<br>
- Pas de subtoot (le fait de parler d&#39;une personne sans la @, mais en espérant qu&#39;elle le voit) négatif. Si vous voulez vous plaindre d&#39;une personne, faites le là où elle ne le verra pas, sinon c&#39;est du harcèlement.<br>
-  Cachez vos propos agressifs. Si vous avez quelque chose de sévère ou d’insultant à dire sur une catégorie de population non couverte par l’article 1 (policiers, personnes cis, gens d’un parti politique opposé au vôtre…), placez-le sous un Content Warning.<br><br></p>

<p><em>Article 3 dit « Du Content Warning »</em> <br>
Veuillez taguer les sujets suivants :<br>
-  NSFW : contenu sexuel et contenu violent/gore<br>
-  Politique, religion, discrimination (transphobie, sexisme, xénophobie...)<br>
-  Santé mentale (dépression, suicide, phobies courantes…) ou physique (sujets médicaux,  alcool, drogues, régimes...)<br>
-  Nourriture<br>
-  Spoilers<br>
-  Gifs ou vidéos avec flash.<br>
-  Les reposts de Twitter. D&#39;ailleurs, si vous tenez à crossposter depuis Twitter, vous êtes prié-e de bien vouloir mettre la visibilité des toots en &quot;non-listé&quot;, afin que la timeline de l&#39;instance ne ressemble pas à un triste clone.<br><br></p>

<p><br><h3 id=""modération"">Principes de modération</h3>
<p>Ce sont des principes un peu généraux, qui dictent mon approche de la modération <i>des autres instances</i>. A l&#39;échelle d&#39;une instance, on peut choisir de silencer ou bloquer une autre instance. Silencer signifie qu&#39;on ne voit plus leurs messages dans la timeline globale, et qu&#39;on ne reçoit pas leurs notifs à moins de déjà suivre le compte qui essaye d&#39;intéragir. Ca permet de maintenir le contact tout en s&#39;évitant certaines interactions spontanées. Bloquer signifie qu&#39;aucun contact n&#39;est possible entre nos instances : on ne peut pas suivre les comptes d&#39;une instance bloquée, et on ne recevra pas leurs notifications non plus.
 <li> Trop de reply guys sur une instance : silence</li>
 <li> Trop de crosspost Twitter : silence</li>
 <li> Absence de modération : silence</li>
 <li> S&#39;il y a des shit-storms régulières ou des accusations qui reviennent sans cesse vers une instance qui se cache derrière une forme de &quot;déni plausible&quot;, au bout d&#39;un moment je considère qu&#39;il y a bien un problème : silence ou block</li>
 <li> Contenu pédo-pornographique : block</li>
 <li> Harcèlement, propos haineux encouragés et/ou non modérés : block</li>
 <li> Instances d&#39;extrême droite : block</li>
 <li> Conspirationnisme, sectes : block</li>
 <li> Instances lancées, acquises ou fondées par Alphabet, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Elsevier : block</li></p> <br></p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>

<p>
    スゥッ…としぁです…。
</p>

<h4>Mastodonは全く知らないのですが、参加してもいいですか。</h4>

<p>
    もちろんです。このサーバーは、mikutterに興味・関心がある人の雑談の場を作ることです。もう私はTwitterを見ることが出来ず、Twitterクライアントもアンインストールしたため、みんなに解脱してほしいです。
</p>

<h4>ておくれていないのですが、参加してもいいですか。</h4>

<p>
    この説明をここまで読んでしまった時点で、お察しなんだよなぁ
</p>

<h4>攻撃的ツイートは凍結対象ですか？</h4>

<p>
    幸い、Mastodonでは投稿のことを「トゥート(toot)」と呼ぶので、問題ありません。Mastodonは初めてか？力抜けよ
</p>

<h4>攻撃的トゥートは凍結対象ですか？</h4>

<p>
    この文章を書いているのはtoshi_aなんですが、昨日あひるの悪ふざけで凍結されましたが、反省文を書こうとしたら解除してもらえました。
</p>

<h4>I don't understand Japanese. Can I join this instance?</h4>

<p>
    日本人は敗戦後、Shift-JISやJAP106などをGHQに押し付けられて、結果として情報工学の発展に大幅な遅れを取りました。私も小学生の頃、プログラミングを始めたら習ったこともない英語が並んでいて挫折したものです。またあなたたちはASCII以外非対応という、日本の小学生でも作らないような低品質なサービスを沢山公開してきました。
    そうやって代々私達が虐げられてきたことを、あなたたちが追体験できる貴重な機会が、このサーバーであるわけです。
</p>

<p>
    (English translated: Yes.)
</p>

<h4>mikutterとしてMastodonサーバーを運営するということは、将来mikutterはMastodonクライアントになるのですか。</h4>

<p>
    いいえ。この話しについては近いうちにどこかの記事で言及するつもりですが、多分このFAQを更新するのは忘れると思うので、「なんか知らんけどそういうわけでもないのかぁ。でもどうなるんだろう？」と、もやもやした気持ちを抱き続けてください。
</p>

79,5b76fa4d8ec14f5384705913,polyglot.city,False,172,"<p>Polyglot City is an instance for people interested in languages, language learning, and translation, as well as multilingual and polyglot people. You're free to toot about any topic (or even about no topic at all) as long as you follow a few simple rules (elaborated below). You can use any language you'd like here -- in fact, the use of different languages is strongly encouraged and appreciated!</p>

<h3>Elaborated rules</h3>

<ol>
<li>No discrimination or harassment of any kind in any language. No nazism or nazi-sympathies. No illegal content. Violations will be moderated and can lead to account deletion.</li>
<li>No bot accounts or accounts used solely for automated crossposting, redirection or data farming. Every account on this instance must be used manually by a real person. Bot accounts and automated accounts will be deleted. (To be clear: You are allowed to follow bots that are on other instances.)
<li>Please consider using a content warning (CW) when tooting about topics that might be sensitive. Common topics for CW are things like politics, mental/physical health, food, alcohol, sex/nudity, images with eye contact. (This list is in no way exhaustive.) In mild cases, not using CW won't lead to moderation, but you will be asked to use CWs. Please note that not using CWs for sensitive topics may lead to our entire instance being blocked by other instances.</li>
<li>We believe the Fediverse is a space for people and communities, not corporations and profiteering. We will proactively block any instances that are run for profit or by for-profit organizations.</li>
<li>In general, try to be considerate and compassionate.</li>
<li>Please follow good Mastodon etiquette.</li>
<li>The rules will be revised as needed. If you think an important rule is missing, please inform the admins.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Moderation circle</h3>

<p>We will try to add moderators as needed to keep up with the volume and common languages on the instance. Our moderation circle currently has the following members:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='https://polyglot.city/@FrankauLux'>@FrankauLux</a> (EN, FR, PT, ES)
</li>
<li><a href='https://polyglot.city/@david'>@david</a> (EN, FR)

</li>
<li><a href='https://polyglot.city/@thurisaz'>@thurisaz</a> (EN, FR, AR, FI)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Suspension of inactive accounts</h3>

<p>At the moment, the hosting of this instance is paid for entirely by the admin, which limits how many active accounts we can support. New registrations might therefore close when we approach the limit. To keep us below the limit, the admin will periodically suspend accounts that have not been used in six months. When this is about to happen, these users will get a direct message telling about incoming suspension. After this announcement, they will have 30 days to reply if they wish to continue to keep the account active. If no reply is received in 30 days, the account will be suspended.</p>

<h3>Governance</h3>

<p>This instance currently has a single admin, but our goal right is to transform the instance into a form of sociocratically organized platform cooperative. A discussion about governance structures is planned; contact the admin if that interests you.</p>

<h3>Credits</h3>

<p>The server thumbnail image is made by <a href='https://polyglot.city/@lpslucasps'>@lpslucasps</a>.</p>

<h3>Privacy & Data Policy</h3>

<p>The instance is hosted by <a href='https://fedi.monster'>fedi.monster</a>, which has its servers in Europe (mainly in Finland). We collect only the information you voluntarily enter in your profile and your toots, and your information is not handed to any third party other than our hosting service. We use no trackers and show no ads. The hosting service may collect some technical information necessary to deliver the service. For more information, see the fedi.monster Privacy Policy. You may delete your own data or account at your will, or ask us to remove your account.</p>

<p>Toots and other data posted on polyglot.city are a communicative act between people. They may not be used to train machine learning systems, create marketing profiles, or other similar practices.</p>

<p>Please note that everything you publish on this instance should be considered publicly visible. Mastodon has a direct message feature, but please note that <em>they are not encrypted messages</em>. If you really want to protect your privacy or send someone private information, please use some other tool than Mastodon for that.</p>
","Polyglot City is the right instance for you if you're interested in linguistics, languages, language learning, or translation, or if you're multilingual or polyglot. All languages are allowed to flourish on our timelines, and multilingual puns are welcome. And of course you're also free to talk about other things besides language.",Polyglot City,,,True

    <h2>Basic Guidelines for Posting</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Engage with one another in good faith</li>
    <li>Respect boundaries as placed by others</li>
    <li>Be respectful/apologize/give space as necessary if someone tells you that you crossed a boundary</li>
    <li>Tag potentially upsetting content such as violence/blood, politics, and pornographic/NSFW material</li>
</ul>

<code>
If you are worried about a situation escalating, contact the Admins 
<a href='https://pounced-on.me/@lio'>@lio</a> or <a href='https://pounced-on.me/@nilsding'>@nilsding</a>
</code>

<h2>Rules</h2>
The following types of content will be removed from the public timeline:

<ul>
    <li>Corporate Advertising <i>(if you are a freelance artist, rock on and promote away, we love you!)</i></li>
    <li>Posts that do not tag potentially upsetting content behind the CW feature, including pornographic or other NSFW material, politics, violence/assault, suicide, etc.</li>
    <li>""Screenshot dunking,"" in which a user posts a screenshot of another post solely to criticize it</li>

    <li>In addition to the tagged content above, we also ask those using a twitter crossposter to tag anything automatically posted to pounced with a ""from twitter"" CW or something similar.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The following types of content will be removed from the public timeline, and will result in account suspension and revocation of access to this server:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Racism or advocation of racism (e.g. using racist pejoratives, advocating white supremacy, etc.)</li>
    <li>Sexism or advocation of sexism (e.g. using sexist pejoratives, mansplaining, etc.)</li>
    <li>Discrimination against gender, romantic, and sexual minorities (e.g. using homophobic/transphobic/queerphobic pejoratives, invalidating others, intentionally ignoring or misusing another's pronouns, etc.)</li>
    <li>Ableism or advocation of ableism (e.g. using ableist pejoratives, pointing out behavior as mental illness as an insult, making light of any physical or mental disabilities that a person experiences, etc.)</li>
    <li>Stalking, harassment, dogpiling, and any other behavior intended to intimidate or provoke others</li>
    <li>Conduct promoting Nazism, xenophobia, white supremacy and any related ideology</li>
    <li>Aggregating, posting, and/or disseminating a person's demographic, personal, or private data without express permission (informally called doxxing)</li>

    <li>Any conduct intended to impede other users from utilizing the service, or to degrade the performance of the service, or to incite other users to perform any of the aforementioned actions</li>
</ul>

<h3> Behaviour to Avoid </h3>

<ul>
    <li>Microaggressions (e.g. white/man/cis-splaining, intentionally using the wrong pronouns to address someone, invalidating other peoples' identities, etc.)</li>
    <li>Demanding education on problematic behaviors from a non-admin/moderator. Users are welcome to educate others, but expecting it from others at all times is an unfair form of emotional labor that places the onus on the marginalized to engage at all
        times Presenting bad-faith arguments and otherwise concern-trolling</li>
</ul>
<p>
    This is not an exhaustive list. If any of these don't make sense or you would like a deeper explanation, please speak with an Admin -- we are more than happy to help you understand the problems with these kinds of behavior.
</p>

<p>Hello Friend and thank you for checking out Beach City, our beautiful beach-side sanctuary on the internet.  Beach City citizens are various flavors of trans, queer, non-binary, Black, POC, polyamorous, disabled, furry, etc. and all know at least a few of their neighbors really well!<br>
<br>
We&#39;re a weird and mixed group of people here, but most of us are well known to someone else on the instance.  If you wanna join us, send someone on here a message and ask. If you&#39;re a well-known friend of theirs, they might just help you get a link!<br><br>

<p>Not affiliated with Steven Universe nor Cartoon Network in any way. We just love them and are lightly theming our instance in a related way. If they ever complain about us, we&#39;ll probably switch to theming ourselves with 80s/vaporwave stylings.
<br><br><br>
<h3>Code of Conduct</h3></p>

<ol><li><em>This is an 18+ server.</em> Do not join or request access if you are not 18 years of age. We will remove accounts that are not 18+ accordingly.</li>
<li><em>Treat others with respect</em >, and be respectful in kind.</li>
<li><em>No systemic abuse</em> such as sexism, racism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, etc. When it comes to defining what constitutes ""systemic abuse"", the opinions of the marginalized are given priority at all times. </li>
<li><em>No unfocused misandry</em>. This is due to its impact on non-binary, genderqueer, trans, disabled, PoC, queer, and otherwise marginalized men, several of whom are on our instance. Misandry focused at the top of the kyriarchy is not against the rules.</li>
<li><em>No harassment</em >. Harassment campaigns may not be spread here, even against ""valid"" targets; this includes doxxing and dogpiling. If you must call someone out, do it elsewhere and link it here. </li>
<li><em>No Quote Tooting</em>. On other social networks it's often used just to show off how horrible someone else is or to draw followers into an argument that should be one-on-one. Attempts to circumvent this through screencaps are prohibited. </li>
<li><em>Don't give unsolicited advice</em> to others. Ask permission before making suggestions to folks.</li>
<li><em>CW sexually explicit content</em> This includes images and text. All sexually explicit images must exclusively involve consent-capable adults. (""Consent-capable"": If asked whether they'd like to pose for an adult photo, they would be capable of responding ""yes"", and that ""yes"" would be able to stand up in court of law.) </li>
<li><em>No scraping content</em> from web interface or API.</li>
<li><em>No public twitter crossposting</em> unless you're on beach city a lot reading and replying. If you are mostly crossposting and not reading, you may post unlisted.</li>
</ol>

<p><hr class=""spacer"">
<p><em>These provisions notwithstanding, the administration of the service reserves the right to revoke any user&#39;s access permissions, at any time, for any reason, except as limited by law.</em></p></p>

<p><hr class=""spacer"">
<h3>Content Warnings</h3>
<p>Content Warnings are a tool to enable someone to opt-into your content.  This is particularly useful when posting publicly, as opposed to unlisted. When you post publicly, your posts are received by people from this server and other servers that may not currently follow you.</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t want to deal with CWs, feel free to post unlisted! Unlisted posts work just like twitter and only go to your profile and followers and or people posts are boosted to.</p>
<p>To use content warnings, click the CW button when composing your toots.  This will  hide the main body of your toot behind a line of text text like a subject line.</p>
<p>Here at Beach City, sexually explicit content, graphically violent content, and similar are required to be CWed.  We heavily suggest you also CW the topics below as well. Topics can get fuzzy, so as long as you&#39;re not malicious with it, it&#39;s fine.</p></p>

<p>

<ul>
<li>Sex and nudity</li>
<li>Drugs, drug use</li>
<li>Personal health, medical issues, hospitals</li>
<li>Depression, anxiety, mental health issues, suicidal thoughts</li>
<li>Food, weight loss, weight gain</li>
<li>Death, funerals</li>
<li>Violence of any kind</li>
<li>Links to Facebook or Twitter</li>
<li>Movie and TV show spoilers</li>
<li>Selfies, eye contact</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a number of other topics you might consider CWing, such as bigotry and politics, but this is something between you and your audience. It's okay to ask others to CW certain topics, but it's also okay to ignore requests for CWs.  People who do not like your CW choices can choose to mute or block you or use filters.</p>

<p>Harassing users to CW their content, as well as demanding CWs from folks talking about their personal experiences of racism and other forms of bigotry, is against our rules and could result in being banned.</p>

<p><hr class=""spacer"">
<h3>Staff</h3></p>

<p>In addition to the site's owner, <a href=""https://beach.city/@pandora_parrot"">@pandora_parrot</a>, Beach.city's moderation staff include:
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href=""https://beach.city/@violetSpark"">@violetSpark</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr class=""spacer"">
<h3>Our promise to you</h3>
<p>We promise to do everything we can to avoid negatively impacting your social media experience. We will immediately block every single example of overt and explicit racism, homophobia, transphobia, etc. We will be judicious about other forms of behavior we find unpleasant. We'll allow you to manage that yourselves, using your own personal block lists and mute lists. If you see a problem you think we need to act on as a server, report the user or toot that is a problem and we will act on it rapidly. We'll bias towards safety and act fast, but always be willing to step back from any mistakes we discover.</p>

<p>This is not a legal document, but rather a guideline of what conduct will be tolerated on this instance.</p>

<p>Particular cases will be judged individually, and we take all reports seriously.</p>

<p>Please avoid using profanity and tearing others down with your words. Remember what Paul wrote in Ephesians 4:29: “Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth, but such as is good for building up as the need may be, that it may give grace to those who hear.”</p>

<p>Harassment of any kind toward anyone for any reason is unacceptable and will result in harsh action against your account.</p>

<p>Speak the truth with love. Both are vital and cannot be divorced.</p>

<p>You won't be banned for calmly voicing your opinions, even if others think they are absurd or incorrect (no arbitrary ""fact checkers""). Just be prepared for friendly discussion about it.</p>

<p>All in all, keep There’s Life a family friendly place and follow Jesus’ teaching in Luke 6:31: “As you would like people to do to you, do exactly so to them.”</p>

<p>So the rules can be summarized as, “Be kind to one another” and “Love others as Christ has loved us.”</p>

<p>For clarification, here are some concrete rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>Content illegal in United States or Germany (location of the server) are not permitted</li>
<li>Don’t post anything sexually suggestive or explicit</li>
<li>Any kind of bigotry against people or their beliefs is prohibited</li>
<li>Be considerate when replying to others’ posts. Would they appreciate the tone or content of your response? Think before you post.</li>
<li>Harassment is prohibited, as mentioned before.</li>
<li>Spam (repeated posting of something identical or similar) is not allowed</li>
<li>Accounts dedicated to promoting a brand or business are not allowed</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, keep There’s Life family friendly.</p>

<h3 id=""bots"">Bots</h3>

<p>No automated posting (without direct human supervision, such as a Twitter crossposter) is allowed on There’s Life without prior permission from a moderator.</p>

<h3 id=""reports"">Reports</h3>

<p>We take all reports from all instances seriously. We also try to respond to those who have made reports to notify them that action has taken place. When reports are sent from other instances, we will try to notify an admin of that instance to let them know what we have done to stop the problem.</p>

<p>Also, when there is a problem with one of our members, please discuss the issue with our admins (<span class=""citation"" data-cites=""life"">@life</span>). We care about issues and want to help address them.</p>

As a concept, librepunk represents the liberation of all people from oppressive systems, from proprietary software to the gender binary, to heteronormativity, ableism, capitalism, racism, and any other machine of oppression. </li>

106,5ce7a49d7b3df93d7ecc5d4f,hellsite.site,False,432,"<p>Hellsite.site is a left wing progressive and welcoming space. to keep it a space open to all where they can feel safe, we have the following guidelines for our users and moderators:
<br><br>
-Discrimination against those lower down on the social ladder this includes, but it not limited to: racism, homophobia, antisemitism, transphobia, classism against the working class, ableism, gate keeping of identities and general exclusionary behavior, misogyny, genocide denial, harassment, Islamophobia. We support and recognise other-kin as well as plural systems, we will not accept any questioning of their legitimacy as identities. We do endorse punching up because reverse racism and things like that aren&#39;t real
<br><br>
-All illegal content is not allowed on Hellsite.site whatsoever, regardless of the legitimacy of the law. Illegal content will get the server taken down, and a one person crusade is not worth that hassle. We do not endorse any illegal actions what so ever on Hellsite.site
<br><br>
-Hellsite.site is an anti fascist space. We endorse and support the idea of deplatforming and fighting fascism at every turn, as such we consistently de-federate with fascistic instances, and do not care who is on those instances. Because of this anti fascist stance, any and all users on Hellsite or other instances will be immediately cut off from our community if there is even any suspicion of fascistic tendencies. explicit fascist dog whistles such as the &#39;((( )))&#39; antisemitic echo and symbols like the frog emoji will be looked at in context, many people may be using things in a non fascist context or not understand the meaning behind something and we are always looking to understand and educate in the fight against fascism 
<br><br>
-Hellsite.site is not an advertising platform. While fund raising and users selling their own products or sex workers advertising to get by is more than acceptable, hellsite.site is not a platform for capitalists to advertise on and park their social media brand accounts on; in the same vein we refuse to allow the platforming of any government agencies or law enforcement on our instance
<br><br>
-As we try to be an accepting space, we ask you do the following to be inclusive in your posting. Use the content warning system to allow for those who may find topics triggering, obvious examples include: food, sexual content, assault, mental health issues, and any other topics at your own discretion; explicitly sexual content should always be marked as such, be it text or images. second of all, we ask that people please use the image description system for all images posted, yes even large blocks of text, it&#39;s very easy for those who are able bodied to transcribe the text and descriptions of visual situations
<br><br>
-Consistent spam is not allowed, even when considered to be a joke by the user. while a repetition of a line here or there may be just a joke, spamming where much of the local timeline is taken up by a single user posting the same or similar variations of a word or phrase fast and continuously will be removed
<br><br>
-Bad faith rules lawyering in an attempt to avoid the clear and obvious progressive intent of these rules is unacceptable behavior, even when done for the sake of &#39;playing devil&#39;s advocate&#39;. if you have issues with the lettering of a point here, please discuss it with the rest of the community and an open and honest criticism
<br><br>
-All rules on hellsite are made by the community, for the community. We are a community who built a space we want to be in, and as such all rules are subject to change by the participation of community members in talking about changing old rules or adding new ones. We welcome new ideas, new perspectives, and a discussion about what makes a space as open and positive as possible. No conversation is final, and old topics are always welcome to be brought back to the table for discussion by the community by any user who requests it
<br><br>
A general failure to follow these guidelines will lead to the removal of your posts, and eventually your account should we decide that the matter is serious enough</p>

<p><a href=""https://docs.mastodon.bgme.bid/zh-cn/"">长毛象</a>是一种<strong>去中心化的社交网络</strong>。大部分社区（比如此站slashine . onl）都是开放的，可以和任何在<a href=""https://slashine.onl/@slashine/104537788488035256"">联邦宇宙</a>中的人互动交流。你可以在此发布你的个人信息流。你发的内容（在这里叫<code>嘟嘟</code>）可以出现在公共时间线，也可以不出现，或者仅仅关注你的人或私信可见。 </p> 

<p>长毛象是一个用来<strong>交流思想，记录日常，和分享创作</strong>的平台。这里没有定制内容的算法，也没有屏蔽词、炸号。默认状态下，长毛象的社交范围是你认识的人认识的人。联邦宇宙中的中文用户目前不算多，没有微博、LOFTER那么热闹，但它的<strong>隐私性、自由度、和自己的数据由自己掌控的感觉</strong>是站长和一些朋友们向往已久的。 <br /> <br /></p> 

<h2>一个小站，名叫slashine</h2>

<p>
本站服务器及运营均位于海外，如有任何疑问可以联系站长 @slashine。<br />
建这个站子的初衷是因为站长使用微博时，既想要圈地自萌同人又想要为社会事件发声，过得很割裂……有了这个站以后，放一些东西就会更自由一些。目前这个站里大都是<strong>欧美斜线向同人爱好&创作者</strong>，但发嘟内容并不限于发同人相关。<br /><br />
<img src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slashine/slashine.github.io/master/assets/img/%E5%A6%B9.png"" align=""right""><strong>站名slashine的由来：</strong>因为认识大家大多是通过斜线slash，shine是瞎想的，希望大家快快乐乐闪闪亮亮w
站址的后缀onl，因为看上去像一个小人用屁股怼墙而获得站长和大家的青睐。

<h3>歡迎訪問</h3>

<p>歡迎來到 Anti Social Science，一個新的長毛象（Mastodon）社群。能夠看到這裏的用戶，應該已經對 Mastodon 有一些瞭解了吧。那麽站長也懶得寫使用指南了……</p>

<p><a href=""https://mastodoncn.netlify.app/"">長毛象中文用戶使用文檔（非官方翻譯）</a></p>

<p><a href=""https://antisocial.science/terms"">長毛象官方隱私政策（英文）</a></p>

<p>其它更詳細的使用説明，請用戶自行搜索。</p>

<p>本站的域名、伺服器、和站務人員，均不位於中國大陸境内（但不提供證明）。站長姑且相信自己有能力維持站點的長期運營，但不會進行言論審查，以降低自己被中國大陸網絡封禁的風險，也不會在被封禁后提供其它的訪問方式。請用戶自行解決翻墻問題。</p>

<h3>本站話題</h3>

<p>雖然很想寫「本站沒有行爲準則」，但是遇到過於惡意的騷擾和發言，可能還是免不了一些屏蔽措施吧。</p>

<p>本站并不致力於，把本機時間軸維護成一個和諧愉悅的社區環境。每個用戶在 Fediverse 獲取的信息，應當取決於他自身關注的不同實例的用戶，而不是局限在本站内部交朋友。本站也沒有特定的聊天主題。因此，只要不主動地去騷擾（at）他人，在本站談論任何正確或不正確的話題都是可以的。</p>

<p>本站的宗旨，是傾向於讓互聯網盡可能地成爲自由的法外之地。所以，大部分和公衆認知乃至和法律相抵觸的行爲或言論，并不能成爲封禁的理由。用戶的言論可能會受到站長的極度不認同和鄙視，但在判定的過程中，站長仍然會盡力傾向於讓這些言論自由地存在。</p>

<p>本站仍需遵從伺服器所在國家的互聯網内容管制法規。猥褻、色情、惡意、謠言、種族主義的相關言論，將受到限制或禁止。尤其禁止與納粹相關的言論和圖片在互聯網上的傳播。站長個人也沒有動力去為這類信息對抗法律爭取自由空間。</p>

<p>本站仍然保留刪除任何嘟文及賬號的權利。有以下行爲的用戶可能會受到警告或封禁：</p>

<ul><li>惡意騷擾，攻擊本站或其它實例的用戶；</li><li>在本機時間軸發佈未進行敏感標記的成人信息；</li><li>被判定為在本機時間軸刷屏推廣垃圾信息。</li></ul>

<p>本站傾向於，不進行實例之間的屏蔽，除非受到代碼層級的惡意攻擊。實例之間的屏蔽，并不能幫助用戶徹底維持其個人網路身份安全。實例的所在地、總體的言論傾向，乃至站長的愚蠢言論，並不能成爲對其屏蔽，限制其用戶與本站互動的理由。</p>

<p>總體來説，希望這裏成爲一個更加公開的環境，希望大家在保障自身安全的前提下，盡量開放而不是鎖嘟。管理員也盡量不出現。</p>

<h3>信息安全</h3>

<p>從技術上講，本站（以及所有 Fediverse 實例的站長）有能力看到自家實例用戶的電子郵件地址、訪問本站時的 IP 地址、和任何公開或隱私的嘟文。本站承諾不會查看、利用、向任何人公開這些信息。</p>

<p>本站强烈建議，用戶注冊時，<strong>不要使用</strong>會與用戶真實身份產生聯係的電子郵箱（如工作郵箱、QQ郵箱、真實姓名拼寫的郵箱用戶名…），但不會因此而拒絕用戶注冊。</p>

<p>請注意：Mastodon 不是加密聊天軟件。即使用戶鎖嘟，或者設置某條嘟文不可見，用戶的所有隱密嘟文，包括發送給其他用戶的「私信」，對於本實例的站長，從技術上都是可以看到的。甚至，所有被允許看到這些隱密嘟文和私信的，其它實例的用戶，他們所在實例的站長，從技術上也都是有能力，從數據庫裏，看到這些信息的。所以，Fediverse 世界裏不存在「真正」隱密的信息，請用戶發文時注意安全。</p>

<h3>知識共享</h3>

<p>除非用戶做單獨聲明，否則在本站創作的所有内容，遵循 CC BY-SA 4.0 的知識共享許可協議。你可以自由地分享和修改這些作品，但必須指出作品原始版本的作者署名，並且你對作品的重製，也必須以相同的授權協議來分享。</p>

<p><a href=""https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode.zh-Hans""><img alt=""Creative Commons License"" src=""https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/4.0/88x31.png""/></a></p>

<p>本協議可能不適用於對自己的作品有獨家獲利預期的用戶，用戶可以標明其獨有的共享許可方式，使本站的默認共享協議不再生效。</p>

<h3>捐助本站</h3>

<p>雖然站長也很想被抖內……但現有的一切捐贈網站，都無法保證站長的隱私不被洩露，——至少網站是知道收款人身份的。其實也不是多麼堅持要隱藏身份，但單純因為收點錢而多一份隱私方面的擔心，並沒有必要。</p>

<p>本站的 bitcoin 收款地址：<br>
bc1qzfx350f52m3nus3p5ud24jcgr0sfsvgucg7942<br>
但只是聊勝於無。站長不會期待從這裡收到任何款項，更不鼓勵大家單純為此而涉足虛擬貨幣領域。</p>

<p>所以，如果有人打算給本站捐贈，可以直接捐給任何社會公益組織，然後和站長說一聲，站長就會很開心地，將你的捐款，作為本站的受捐贈記錄。當然，品味過於奇異的捐贈方向，可能會遭受站長的白眼和拒絕。但我相信你不會捐給 ISIS 啦。</p>

<h4>使用建議</h4>

<p>作為自負成本的小站，本站目前的主要壓力，是用戶上傳的媒體文件，導致未來在線存儲空間不足的風險及額外費用。所以，站長希望大家，不要把本站作為圖床使用。幾百 KB 的圖片，足以作為網絡交流使用；更大體積的圖片似乎並沒有必要。但站長並沒有對上傳圖片大小作出限制，只是希望大家配合（鞠躬</p>

119,6038d8af88f1bd03b0d0fee5,cathode.church,False,209,"<h1 class=""atx"" id=""the-church-of-cathode"">The Church of Cathode</h1>

<p>Cathode Church is a Mastodon instance on the Fediverse for trans and gender-diverse makers, coders and tinkerers.</p>

<p>It is intended to be a supportive, friendly, and creative online space.</p>

<h2 class=""atx"" id=""tenets"">Tenets</h2>

<h3 class=""atx"" id=""courtesy"">Courtesy</h3>

<p>Harassment, vitriol, exploitation and abuse are not tolerated. This includes racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism and other expressions of power across structural power/privilege differentials.</p>

<p>Respect and venerate the great constellation of human experience and self-expression, across gender, sexuality, neurology, psychology, body, ability, race, identity, culture, spirituality, et cetera.</p>

<p>Content warnings should be used in accordance with evolving community standards and the needs of fellow users.</p>

<p>Accounts posting content not suitable for minors such as pornography or explicit sexual content should be locked and clearly marked as 18+ only in the display name or bio. The account-holder must reject follow requests from users who do not make clear that they are over 18. All posts containing explicit material must also be content-warned as such and have media hidden.</p>

<p>Bot accounts are allowed, but must not interact with other users without their consent.</p>

<p>Copyrighted content should not be posted without permission, and always with credit, ideally hyperlinking to the author's online presence.</p>

<h3 class=""atx"" id=""solidarity"">Solidarity</h3>

<p>Church users are expected to work to educate themselves and support their fellows with different lived experiences, cultures, beliefs, and intersections of structural power. It is not the responsibility of those whose identity or experience you do not understand to explain themselves to those yet uninformed. Any education offered is given as a favour and should be respected as such.</p>

<p>No one person can champion all worthy causes, and bigotry cannot be fought on any single front. Respect the work of those who are dedicated to different parts of the fight. Respect the capacity of others.</p>

<h4 class=""atx"" id=""irradiate-the-rich"">Irradiate the Rich</h4>

<p>As part of our Solidarity, always remember who the greater persecutor is, who is responsible for the ignorance of our peers, and oppression of our communities. Disagreements among us are important and natural but can obscure the greater perspective.</p>

<h3 class=""atx"" id=""intersectionality"">Intersectionality</h3>

<p>Solidarity is meaningless without acknowledging and actively working against the multitudinous gradients of privilege/power any of us may hold over others. Consider your privileges and their ramifications when engaging with other users.</p>

<h3 class=""atx"" id=""privacy"">Privacy</h3>

<p> Church users are not required or expected to disclose or externally verify any aspects of their identity or to administrators other than a functioning email for signup, excluding conditions agreed to during the sign-up process.</p>

<p>Creating or using alternate accounts to evade blocks, mutings, suspensions or silencings is not allowed by any users.</p>

<h3 class=""atx"" id=""advocacy"">Advocacy</h3>

<p>Instances with a history of permitting harassment, abusive behaviour, and spam by their users will be blocked, regardless of the wording of their policies.</p>

<p>Church administrators will stand behind users reporting harassment and personally follow up where necessary and wanted, maintaining the anonymity of our users where possible, including against other church users.</p>

<h4 class=""atx"" id=""moderating-disputes"">Moderating disputes</h4>

<p>Where a church user is under investigation for violating the Tenets, they will be informed of such as soon as practical, and offered the right of defence through a moderator. No public announcements will be made until a final decision is settled, and only if the decision affects other parties (such as in the case of an outright ban of a serial harasser).</p>

<p>Both those accused and those reporting are requested to avoid non-conciliatory public interaction with each other, 'callouts', and the like, until moderating decisions have been made.</p>

<h3 class=""atx"" id=""ephemerality"">Ephemerality</h3>

<p>The highest priority of Cathode Church is maintaining the safety of our users and this can contradict some assumptions of federating software regarding open access. The server is configured to disable search indexing and unauthenticated viewing of the timeline or toots where possible. Known fulltext-indexers are blocked. Hosts detected attempting to scan/crawl media files will be blocked.</p>

<p>That said, it is not recommended to rely on the security of Mastodon for very private information.</p>

<h3 class=""atx"" id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h3>

<p>To be considered for an account, you must confirm that you have read and understood these responsibilities and expectations, by mentioning the Tenets in the ""Why do you want to join?"" field. If you do not, your account will not be activated.</p>

<p>If you have any issues, email s0 at this domain.</p>

<h2 class=""atx"" id=""administrative-details"">Administrative details</h2>

<h3 class=""atx"" id=""technical"">Technical</h3>

<p>Cathode Church is run off a VPS in Sydney, Australia, and uses OpenStack Object Storage also in Sydney for media storage. The site should be fully accessible via IPv6 and modern HTTPS/TLS.</p>

<h4 class=""atx"" id=""multiple-sessions"">Multiple Sessions</h4>

<p>Inspired by <a href=""https://vulpine.club"">vulpine.club</a>'s setup, it is possible to maintain multiple separate sessions for separate accounts by using the subdomains <a href=""https://0.cathode.church"">0.cathode.church</a>, <a href=""https://1.cathode.church"">1.cathode.church</a>, <a href=""https://2.cathode.church"">2.cathode.church</a>, and <a href=""https://3.cathode.church"">3.cathode.church</a>.</p>

<h4 class=""atx"" id=""local-only-posting"">Local-only Posting</h4>

<p>Toots that end with 👁 or have ""Local-only"" enabled in the web interface are not federated from cathode.church to any other instance. They are only visible to Cathode Church users (depending on the toot visibility setting).</p>

<h3>A letter from the Admin</h3>

<p><em>Hello cyberspace traveler,<br />
<br /></p>

<p>Welcome to my little witchy occult aesthetic corner of the web. I’ve tried to make a space where others interested in spirituality, paganism, and generally off the beaten path ideologies can collaborate and share. My intent is to be the groundskeeper of a shared public space where others can learn and grow while learning from and helping others grow too. (And I kinda like some of the occult aesthetics.) My personal background being what it is as a white male working in the tech sector, I know I have a number of blind spots and unknown unknowns when it comes to some wider societal and cultural experiences. I am trying to keep an open mind and open gates to all. That said, I’m also aware that some aspects of this area have been appropriated, stolen, or co-opted by colonizers and haters, and will do my best to keep these poisonous pests from this garden so it stays a safe and nurturing space.<br /></p>

<p>So, again, welcome and well met friend, join us and grow, and may you receive everything you deserve.<br />

These Subject Lines do not prevent a post from reaching anyone, it is used to tell people about sensitive topics in the post, to hide a very long post, or set up a knock-knock joke. For remote servers, a lack of appropriate content warnings may result in multiple other servers de-federating with them so they do not have to moderate another server’s content.
        <ol>
            <li>Sensitive Images: Images should be marked <u>Sensitive</u> if they meet any of the following criteria
                <ul>
                    <li>Selfies or eye contact (this is general mastodon best practice).</li>
                    <li>Food: Images of food should be marked as sensitive</li>
                    <li>Strobing, flashing, or other animated gif types that may be sensitive to those with epilepsy.</li>
                    <li>Sexualy explicit images</li>
                    <li>any content that would fall under the following Content Warning category.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Content Warnings should also be included for the following topics:
                <ul>
                    <li>Mental Health: anxiety, depression, trauma, abuse, etc</li>
                    <li>Current Events: Politics, news, tragic events, etc</li>
                    <li>Drug Use: Cannabis, alcohol, smoking, psychedelics, etc</li>
                    <li>the traumatic circumstances involved when making Requests for aid, payments, frequent advertising of services, etc</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol></p>

<p>For cases of nudity: Breasts are not genitalia and do not need a Sensitive Image flag. However, sexualized or fetish content that only has breasts would still be a sexualized image, and require a Sensitive image flag at least. Images with genitalia should be marked as sensitive.</p>
        

<h3>Reporting</h3>

<p>Posts in violation of our Guidelines or ToS should be reported using the Report button on the post. A note as to why it was reported should be included. This applies for local and federated content. Reporting is a community responsibility as there is zero automatic filtering or curation of public data. Contribute to our community by saying something if you see something.</p>

<h2>Privacy</h2>

<p>There are some features you can use to attempt to limit your visibility, but these should not be considered secure by any measure. Staff will do their best to respect your privacy and data, and will not seek out information outside of what is necessary in the fulfillment of their duties of their roles. <br /></p>

<p>That said, the ActivityPub protocol, and Mastodon in general, were not built or designed with privacy at the core. These are social tools intended to enable sharing to many people. What that means for you is that you can expect no level of guaranteed privacy. Not for your posts and Direct Messages, not for your account information, including registration email, IP address, and details you provide. Not from Admin and Staff of this instance or (at present) our hosting providers.</p>

<h2>Availability</h2>

<p>We will do our best to maintain as much uptime as possible and mitigate the chances of data loss and downtime. We will allow for at least 90 days notice of server shutdown. That said, we do not currently control our own hosting environment nor have we obtained backups of data. If you are concerned about loss of data such as your posts, follow and block lists, or account information, you may use the Profile Settings options to make periodic backups of your data. We allow profile exports and redirects at this time, and in most cases will allow 30 days for banned accounts to retrieve their data at the discretion of the staff.
<br /></p>

<h2 id=donate>Donations</h2>

<script src=""https://liberapay.com/Crazypedia/widgets/receiving.js""></script>

<p>Donations are currently being accepted through LiberaPay in the form of recurring donations and single payments. Payment types supported by Stripe and PayPal are accepted. Our goal is to get enough small recurring donations to cover the month-to-month costs of the server and domain and reduce the administrator's out of pocket costs. Donations are only wanted on a pay-what-you-can-afford basis, and no preasure to contribute is intended.</p>

<p><a href=""https://liberapay.com/Crazypedia/donate"" target=_blank><img src=""https://img.shields.io/liberapay/receives/Crazypedia.svg?logo=liberapay""> <img src=""https://img.shields.io/liberapay/goal/Crazypedia.svg?logo=liberapay""></a><img src=""https://img.shields.io/liberapay/patrons/Crazypedia.svg?logo=liberapay""></p>

<h2>About ActivityPub, Mastodon, and Hometown</h2>

<p>Ah, the technical stuff! Being a computer person by trade, I find some of this stuff really fascinating. Magic can be found in the wires, and sometimes knowing how the Rube Goldberg mouse-trap cluster heck of the internet works is magic in and of itself. Here I’ll offer a brief overview of some of the different aspects and components that make this social space possible.</p>

<h3>Basics of ActivityPub</h3>

<p>ActivityPub can be thought of, at its most basic, as a new type of email protocol. It allows you and others to send and receive messages and media of various types between different servers online in much the same way as email. It’s format and intended use is as an alternative to other microblogging, social media, and writing platforms and services online. ActivityPub Servers are independently owned and operated by a wide variety of system administrators, with a wide background of values, beliefs, and experiences. Servers are often specialized into niche community interests or topics of focus, and even run different types of software such as Friendica, HubZilla, PeerTube, PixelFed, Plume, Misskey, WriteFreely, and others in addition to Mastodon.<br />
You can check out <a href=""http://activitypub.rocks/"" target=_blank>ActivityPub.Rocks</a> for further technical specifications.</p>

<h3>What is Mastodon?</h3>

<p>Mastodon is the server side application that first implemented and shaped ActivityPub, and is one of the most widely used software packages for ActivityPub services. The original server, Mastodon.Social, set many trends and norms for the community as a whole in the early days, and other servers have since taken up the torch of dictating norms and acceptable behavior for their own users and others that interact with them. The original Mastodon services included a 500 character post limit(up from Twitter’s 250), and custom emoji or emoticons that could be uploaded by admins to offer a more unique flavor to communications. <br /></p>

<p>You can learn more about Mastodon at the <a href=""https://docs.joinmastodon.org/"" target=_blank>  main documentation site</a>, or from <a href=""https://fediverse.party/en/mastodon"" target=_blank>Fediverse.Party</a>.</p>

<h3>What is Hometown?</h3>

<p>Hometown is a fork, or derivative based on the main Mastodon server code. It was developed by Darius Kazemi and others to add features and address issues that have not been added to the main Mastodon services. Some of these features are listed below. Hometown’s main code repository can be found here: <br />
<a href=""https://github.com/hometown-fork/hometown"" target=_blank>HomeTown @ GitHub</a><br /></p>

<h4>Hometown Features</h4>

<h5>Local Only Posting</h5>

<p>This feature allows you to make a post that stays on the local server and does not federate to the larger fediverse. This may be useful if you’re interested only in the opinions of your peers on your server or have a specific interest and don’t want comments or reactions from the peanut gallery. <br />
You can use this on our server by adding the <em>:local_only:</em> emote to a post, or selecting the chain link icon on the interface to make your post local only.</p>

<h5>More privacy features</h5>

<p>A number of privacy features and options have been added to further limit access to an account if you choose.</p>

<h5>Better content types and more ways to interact</h5>

<p>Whereas core Mastodon treats certain types of content metadata as a defacto standard of sharing, Hometown is trying to make more post types specified in the ActivityPub standards guide accessible natively. What this means for you is a better reading experience when coming across different types of posts, and better sharing experiences for your friends and followers. Many of these improvements are still in the discussion and development stages at this time.</p>

<h2 id=start>Getting Started</h2>

<p>So, you’re joining your first fediverse server and want to know where to start. Great! Here are a few great tips!
<ol>
    <li>Write and Introduction post!</li>
        <ul>Talking about yourself can be hard, but a post that talks about your interests and what you hope to find on the fediverse and using the #introductions hashtag helps people with similar interests find each other, so use plenty of hashtags in your introduction! You can always re-write it later too.</ul>
    <li>Hashtags!
</li>
        <ul>Hashtags are a powerful tool in the fediverse, allowing you to find other posts that use a particular tag, and it helps others find what you’reposting about too! You’ll only see posts that your server has seen though, meaning someone on your server has to have been following or seen the a post with said hashtag for it to show up.</ul>
    <li>Fill out your profile!
</li>
        <ul>Having a profile picture that represents ‘you’ can be a factor in if people want to interact with you or assume yours is an inactive account. Filling in your profile description and info fields is important too. (The info fields are free form, so go wild. Many use it to include their pronouns, languages they know, or other interesting or silly info) Many people make a login but don’t fill out their profile and wonder why no one wants to interact with them, but it’s very hard to interact with someone if all you know is their username!</ul>
    <li>Check out the Follow Friday tags or A.Gup.Pe discussion groups.
</li>
        <ul>The #FollowFriday or #ff tags are used by people on the fediverse to personally recommend cool accounts to follow. Since there are no algorithms determining what content you see, its important to occasionally tell others about all the cool stuff you’re finding! Additionally, the a.gup.pe bot service works similarly to hashtags, but instead it broadcasts the messages sent to the group to anyone else following that same group. Check out <a href=""https://pagan.plus/@kitchenwitch@a.gup.pe"" target=_blank>@KitchenWitch@a.gup.pe</a> to see what I mean.</ul>
    <li>
</li></p>

125,60d483f888f1bd03b0d0ffa1,dragonscave.space,False,396,"<h1>Welcome to the Dragon's Cave!</h1>

<p>The Dragon's cave is a small dragon-themed community of mostly visually impaired folks. Everyone is welcome, however, as long as they are a kind and friendly person. You can expect posts about accessibility, development, gaming, privacy, and other technology related topics, but also food, music, poetry, short stories, and other things of interest.</p>

<p>Are you curious about why you should join this instance over all the others out there? Here are some of the things we offer:</p>

<ul>
<li>A cool domain name (at least if you like dragons, but who doesn't?)</li>
<li>Roars, rather than posts, to fit the draconic theme.</li>
<li>A small and pleasant local community — with an option of local-only posting if you're feeling shy — as well as plenty of friends awaiting you in the vast Fediverse outside of it.</li>
<li>Four mostly-benevolent staff members who regularly check and respond to reports, questions, and requests.</li>
<li>A larger character limit, 3000 instead of 500, so you will always have enough space to express your opinions clearly.</li>
<li>A few useful features added by the Mastodon fork Glitch, such as the aforementioned local-only posting and bigger character limit and better formatting of posts from other software in the Fediverse.</li>
<li>A small collection of custom emojis, which we'll gladly expand upon request.
</ul>

<p>If this has convinced you, please familiarize yourself with our etiquette and then send us an application! Since we receive a large volume of spam signups, we would appreciate if you told us a little about yourself and why you wish to join. Remember to include the confirmation password that proves you have read the rules, which you can find below them.</p>

<h2>The Dragon's Cave Etiquette</h2>

<p>We want this instance to be a welcoming and comfortable space -- idealy for everyone, but most of all for those who are marginalised and cannot as easily find one elsewhere. To achieve this, keep the following five rules in mind. As it would be impossible to include everything, consider them a basic moral framework, which the administrators will use to act upon each individual issue in good faith. However, if you already have the urge to test the limits of these rules, or disagree with some or all of them, this instance is not for you.</p>

<h3>1. Be Decent</h3>

<p>Do not harass, insult, or otherwise intentionally harm other users of any kind, local or federated. Do not discriminate against people based on any of the various things that make humanity so beautiful and diverse, including but not limited to: age, appearance, body shape and size, disability, ethnicity, gender, nationality, race, religion or lack thereof, sexual orientation, etc.</p>

<p>This instance is not the place to debate the existence of so-called reverse racism, or to respond to systemic critiques with the ""not all X"" defense.</p>

<p>Do not deliberately spread misinformation, including pseudoscience and conspiracy theories. Given the dangers of the current situation we find ourselves in, COVID-19 related misinformation will be dealt with especially strictly; do not post or boost any misinformation minimizing the virus's impact, accusing the medical community or affected people of lying, or  discouraging social distancing, vaccinations, and the wearing of masks.</p>

<h3>2. Be Sentient</h3>

<p>Avoid creating advertising or bot accounts on this instance without permission. There may be exceptions, but it is best to consult with the administrators before going ahead. Please consider instead joining one of the specialized instances for bot accounts, which are a better place for your account's visibility and discoverability, as well as the health of our instance's timelines and federation.</p>

<h3>3. Be Active</h3>

<p>Cross posting (using software to post the same content on multiple social media services) is only allowed if you regularly check your account here and interact with notifications. Please set cross posts to Unlisted or stricter. Do not crosspost content from other people, such as retweets, unless you have their consent to share it on other platforms.</p>

<h3>4. Be Lawful</h3>

<p>Do not post or link to content that could get us hit with a violation of copyright. Only post personally identifiable information if you have explicit permission to do so. In general, if you are not sure whether or not to share something, it is likely you should not. Keep in mind that this instance is hosted in Germany and thus abides by its laws.</p>

<p>Please post any sexual content as Unlisted or stricter, and make sure to add an appropriate content warning. If you regularly find yourself wanting to post content of sexual nature, this may not be the best instance for you. Do not post any sexualized depictions of animals, minors, or sexual assault, regardless of whether they are real or fictional.</p>

<h3>5. Be Mindful</h3>

<p>Politics, Religion, and other controversial topics should be posted behind a content warning. Be mindful of people you interact with, as they may have had experiences drastically different from yours, including severe psychological or physical trauma. Content warnings are no inconvenience for you as a user, and will provide a much higher well being for individuals that might want to read your content, but prefer not to get involved in those topics due to various reasons.</p>

<p>What SHOULD contain a CW?: AI content, alcohol or drugs (especially when talking about extreme entoxication or disparaging sobriety), anything of a sexual nature (this should also be Unlisted or stricter), covid-19, physical and mental health, recounting violent or alarming encounters, religion, trauma, war.</p>

<p>Things that are considerate to CW: Eye contact (For images), food, family, long threads, talking about other social media, trending topics, unusual things for you to post about.</p>

<p>Please try to describe your media posts to the best of your ability to accommodate disabilities such as blindness and deafness. If you cannot do so, there is nothing wrong with asking for help. Currently, tagging <a href=""https://a.gup.pe/u/imagecaptionspls"">@ImageCaptionsPls@a.gup.pe</a> is the best way to do so.</p>

<h1>The Confirmation Password</h1>

<p>You have reached the end of our etiquette. Thank you for your diligence! The password you should add to your application is: confelicity. We chose it because it is a sadly uncommon word, meaning ""pleasure in another's happiness.""</p>

<h2>Instance Administration</h2>

<p>Dragon's Cave is currently moderated by four people: <a rel=""me"" href=""https://dragonscave.space/@talon"">Talon</a>, <a rel=""me"" href=""https://dragonscave.space/@Mayana"">Mayana</a>, <a rel=""me"" href=""https://dragonscave.space/@fireborn"">Fireborn</a> and <a rel=""me"" href=""https://dragonscave.space/@thequinbox"">Quin</a>. We do our best to take care of the instance, but we are just volunteers, and only human. If you come upon any objectionable content, please report it, and we will respond as soon as possible. Additionally, feel free to <a href=""https://dragonscave.space/@admin"">reach out to us</a> if you would like us to change something about the rules above, the instance moderation actions below, or anything else related to the instance.</p>

<p>If possible, please mention the <a rel=""me"" href=""https://dragonscave.space/@admin"">administration account</a> and not our personal accounts.</p>

<h2>Donations</h2>

<p>This server is run by volunteers. If you'd like to help keep it running, feel free to donate on <a href=""https://ko-fi.com/TalonTheDragon"">Ko-Fi</a>
<p>We are currently looking into setting up a recurring donation service. Once we have one, it will show up here.</p>

<h3>Operating costs</h3>

<p>Here is a list of all the monthly and yearly expenses to run the Dragon's Cave.</p>

<ul>
<li>Server: 42 euro/month</li>
<li>Email: 36 euro/month</li>
<li>Media storage: about 5 to 6 euro/month</li>
<li>Domain: about 17-18 euro/year</li>

<h3>COSA</h3>

<p>Puntarella.party è un social network indipendente, libero da logiche di profitto, non regolato da nessun algoritmo, antifascista, antirazzista e antisessista, basato a Roma. Più precisamente è un nodo (istanza) di una rete di centinaia di altri server indipendenti in tutto il mondo (Fediverso) e che adotta un software di microblogging (<a href=""https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging"" target=""_blank"">che vuol dire?</a>): Mastodon. Come funziona Mastodon? C&#39;è un&#39;ottima guida su <a href=""https://mastodon.help"" target=""_blank"">mastodon.help</a>. C&#39;è da aggiungere solo che da noi un post (toot) può essere lungo fino a 840 caratteri.
<h3>CHI</h3>
Il collettivo di gestione di Puntarella.Party nasce dall&#39;incontro tra alcunə utenti abitanti tra Roma e il Lazio e attivə da tempo all&#39;istanza Mastodon bolognese, <a href=""mastodon.bida.im"" target=""_blank"">mastodon.bida.im</a>, e dalla decisione di provare a riprodurre un&#39;esperienza simile nel territorio romano. Lə compagnə di Bida, pionierə del fediverso italofono, hanno sempre invitato a dare vita a istanze locali: raccogliamo la sfida, come già avvenuto a Milano (<a href=""https://nebbia.fail/"" target=""_blank"">nebbia.fail</a>) e Torino (<a href=""mastodon.cisti.org"" target=""_blank"">mastodon.cisti.org</a>).
Il collettivo si fonda su meccanismi di fiducia e di conoscenza diretta e non solo virtuale; ha l&#39;onere del mantenimento dell&#39;infrastruttura tecnica e della moderazione dei contenuti secondo la policy</p>

<h3>PER CHI</h3>

<p>Puntarella.party si rivolge a tutte e tutti coloro che ambiscono alla trasformazione dell&#39;esistente in direzione di una piena giustizia sociale, agli spazi sociali, ai collettivi, alle esperienze di attivismo, per offirire uno strumento di informazione, confronto, discussione alternativo alle grandi piattaforme commerciali. Per iscriversi all&#39;istanza è necessario l&#39;invio di qualche breve riga di presentazione.</p>

<h3>COME</h3>

<p>Le interazioni sull&#39;istanza sono regolate da una policy, la cui prima stesura è stata decisa dal collettivo sulla base della visione della realtà condivisa tra ə suə componenti e sulla base dell&#39;esperienza pregressa sulle istanze Mastodon italofone. La policy può essere emendata tramite applicazione del metodo del consenso da assemblee di istanza da tenersi in presenza e che (appena sarà possibile) verranno convocate con regolarità.
Oltre a seguire le indicazioni della policy perché l&#39;esperimento funzioni e sia durevole è indispensabile che ogni utente si impegni a interagire in modo costruttivo, rispettoso, non competitivo, a non fare dell&#39;istanza uno sfogatoio di dissidi nati al suo esterno. 
La qualità delle interazioni all&#39;interno di una comunità del fediverso, per quanto finora osservato, dipende molto più dalla capacità che essa ha di autodeterminarsi che dal disegno della piattaforma su cui queste interazioni hanno luogo: per questo Puntarella.Party non adotterà la prassi di orientare il comportamento dell&#39;utenza intervenendo tecnicamente sul software, limitandone o eliminandone funzioni.
La priorità è la diffusione di contenuti di informazione e di analisi, ma un social network ha anche bisogno della sua quota di frivolezze e gattini.

<h3>1.b COSA METTERE SOTTO ""CONTENT WARNING""</h3>

<p>(<a href=""https://mastodon.help/#ContentWarning"" target=""_blank"">cosa vuol dire?</a>)<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>nudo, erotismo, pornografia (usare anche #nsfw - <a href=""https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSFW"" target=""_blank"">cos&#39;è?</a>)</li>
<li>immagini di violenza</li>
<li>contenuti splatter / gore</li>
<li>contenuti che altri utenti hanno già segnalato come fonte di disagio</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>2. SOFFERENZA PSICOLOGICA</h3>

<p>Qualora sull&#39;istanza unə utente esprimano situazioni di sofferenza psicologica e/o possibili azioni auto/etero lesive e/o suicidarie, la comunità si impegna ad interagire con l&#39;utente, attivando risposte di ascolto e/o sostegno, cercando di individuare/attivare account amicə o possibili conoscenti e/o reti di mutuo aiuto sul territorio qualora la posizione dell&#39;utente sia nota alla comunità.&quot;</p>

<h3>3. INTIMITÀ VIOLATE</h3>

<p>Nel caso di contenuti #nsfw a sfondo erotico/sessuale di provenienza dubbia, gli/le admin possono chiedere di contestualizzare l&#39;origine di tali contenuti. Con &quot;provenienza dubbia&quot; intendiamo casi in cui non sia chiaro il consenso delle persone ritratte, cioè possibili casi di revenge porn, intimitá violate etc. Gli utenti che postano questo tipo di contenuti sono immediatamente silenziati fino all&#39;avvenuto chiarimento.</p>

<h3>4. BOT</h3>

<p>Chi gestisce un bot (account gestito da un software) dovrà inserire nel profilo del bot un account mastodon reperibile a cui contattarlo, o quantomeno rispondere tramite il bot stesso. Diversamente, gli/le admin si riservano di cancellare il bot. Tutti i punti del manifesto si applicano anche ai bot. I bot automatici (per esempio: bot di gif, di giochi di parole, di emoji...) possono postare una volta ogni 5 ore. I bot collegati a feed rss/atom possono pubblicare indicativamente fino a 10 toot al giorno. Resta possibile concordare una frequenza diversa per bot che non pubblicano sulla timeline locale (contattare gli/le admin per richieste specifiche).</p>

<h3>5. FLOOD</h3>

<p>Non si puó intasare la timeline locale con toot ripetuti e/o in stretta successione (cosiddetto &quot;flood&quot;). Non ci sono limiti specifici per gli account &quot;umani&quot;, gli/le admin valutano le segnalazioni della comunità. Il live-tooting di manifestazioni, assemblee, iniziative sociali autogestite non è mai considerato flood.</p>

<h3>6. LINGUE</h3>

<p>Lingue accettate:
<li>italiano</li>
<li>inglese</li>
<li>spagnolo</li>
<li>francese</li>
<li>polacco</li>
per ragioni di moderazione</p>

<h3>7. DATI</h3>

<p>I contenuti di questa istanza non possono essere usati per fini di ricerca o machine learning senza l&#39;esplicito consenso degli utenti coinvolti I contenuti di istanza non possono essere archiviati o indicizzati in blocco da nessun utente o servizio.

<h2>PUNTARELLA.PARTY&#39;S MANIFESTO</h2>

<h3>WHAT</h3>

<p>Puntarella.party is an independent social network, free from profit logic, not regulated by any algorithm, anti-fascist, anti-racist and anti-sexist, based in Rome. More precisely, it is a node (instance) of a network of hundreds of other independent servers around the world (Fediverse) and it adopts a microblogging software (what does that mean?): Mastodon. How does Mastodon work? There is an excellent guide on (an excellent guide is available at) mastodon.help. We only need to add that here a post (toot) can be up to 840 characters long.</p>

<h3>WHO</h3>

<p>The collective managing Puntarella.Party was born when some Mastodon users living between Rome and Lazio and active in the Bologna Mastodon instance - mastodon.bida.im - met in person, and decided to try to reproduce a similar experience in the Roman territory. The comrades from Bida, pioneers of the italophone Fediverse, have always called for the creation of local instances: we took up the challenge, as it has already happened in Milan (nebbia.fail) and Turin (mastodon.cisti.org). The collective is based on mechanisms of trust and in real life meetings, not just virtual; it is responsible for maintaining the technical infrastructure and moderating the content according to the policy</p>

<h3>FOR WHOM</h3>

<p>Puntarella.party is a place for all those who aspire to the transformation of the existing in the direction of full social justice, for social spaces, collectives, activist experiences, in order to offer a tool for information, confrontation, discussion, as an alternative to big commercial platforms. To sign up to the instance, please send a few lines of presentation.</p>

<h3>HOW TO</h3>

<p>Interactions on the instance are regulated by a policy, the first draft of which was decided by the collective on the basis of a vision of reality shared by its members and on the basis of previous experiences on the Italian-speaking Mastodon instances. The policy can be amended through the application of consensus decision-making by (an instance assembly) instance assemblies to be held in person and which (as soon as possible) will be convened on a regular basis. In addition to following the indications of the policy, in order for the experiment to work and be long-lasting, it is crucial that each user undertakes to interact in a constructive, respectful, non-competitive manner, and not to make the instance a venting ground for disagreements originating outside it. The quality of interactions within a community of the fediverse, as far as has been observed up to now, depends much more on its capacity to self-determine itself than on the design of the platform on which these interactions take place: this is why Puntarella.Party will not adopt the practice of directing user behaviour by technically intervening in the software, limiting or eliminating functions. The priority is the dissemination of information and analysis, but a social network also needs its share of frivolities and kittens.</p>

<h2>THE POLICY: WHAT YOU CAN DO, WHAT YOU CANNOT DO</h2>

<h3>1. WHAT YOU CANNOT PUBLISH</h3>

<p><li>racist, sexist, homophobic, fascist, discriminatory, militarist content</li></p>

<p><li>electoral, party, institutional, and nationalist propaganda messages. Political party accounts will not be accepted; we do not exclude that a private account may publicise initiatives, events or analyses that can be traced back to political parties, we appeal to the self-regulation of individuals; in the two months preceding an election, moderation may be more stringent</li></p>

<p><li>messages aimed exclusively at promoting commercial activities</li></p>

<p><li>threats, insults, disparaging messages towards other users of the fediverse</li></p>

<p><li>direct links to commercial social networks (facebook, instagram, twitter, tiktok); no ban, however, for telegram, reddit and audio and video streaming platforms</li></p>

<p><li>content denying historically or scientifically established facts, conspiracy theories. Except in extreme cases, there will be a tendency to favour confrontation over moderation, to be exercised with flexibility</li></p>

<p><li>content that invites or celebrates acts of bloodshed</li></p>

<p><li>private and sensitive data. In particular, revealing the identity of other users is not permitted</li></p>

<p>The collective reserves the right to request the removal or directly remove any content that may be harmful to the collective itself or to other users.</p>

<h3>1.b WHAT TO PUT UNDER &quot;CONTENT WARNING&quot; (what does it mean?)</h3>

<p><li>nudity, eroticism, pornography (use #nsfw - what is that?)</li></p>

<p><li>images of violence</li></p>

<p><li>splatter / gore content</li></p>

<p><li>content that other users have already reported as causing discomfort</li></p>

<h3>2. PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS</h3>

<p>In the event that a user expresses situations of psychological suffering and/or possible self-/other-injury and/or suicidal intents, the community undertakes the responsibility to interact with the user, activating listening and/or support responses, trying to identify/activate friends&#39; accounts or possible acquaintances and/or mutual aid networks in the area if the user&#39;s position is known to the community.</p>

<h3>3. VIOLATED INTIMACY</h3>

<p>In the case of erotic/sexual #nsfw content of dubious provenance, admins may ask you to contextualise the origin of such content. By &#39;dubious provenance&#39; we mean cases where the consent of the persons depicted is unclear, i.e. possible cases of revenge porn, violated intimacy etc. Users who post this type of content are immediately silenced until clarification is provided.</p>

<h3>4. BOT</h3>

<p>Whoever operates a bot (account managed by a software) shall include in the bot&#39;s profile a reachable Mastodon account to which they can be contacted, or at least reply via the bot itself. Otherwise, the admins reserve the right to delete the bot. All points in the manifesto also apply to bots. Automatic bots (e.g. gif bots, pun bots, emoji bots...) may post once every 5 hours. Bots linked to rss/atom feeds can post up to 10 toots per day, approximately. It remains possible to agree on a different frequency for bots that do not publish on the local timeline (contact admins for specific requests).</p>

<h3>5. FLOODING</h3>

<p>You cannot clog the local timeline with repeated toots and/or in close succession (so-called &#39;flooding&#39;). There are no specific limits for &#39;human&#39; accounts, the admins assess the reports of the community. Live-tooting of events, assemblies, self-managed social initiatives is never considered flooding.</p>

<h3>6. LANGUAGES</h3>

<p>Accepted languages:</p>

<p><li>Italian</li></p>

<p><li>English</li></p>

<p><li>Spanish</li></p>

<p><li>French</li></p>

<p><li>Polish</li></p>

<p>for moderation reasons</p>

<h3>7. DATA</h3>

<p>Instance content may not be used for research or machine learning purposes without the explicit consent of the users involved. Instance content may not be archived or indexed in bulk by any user or service. Active users can export their list of followers and the content of their posts via the web interface.</p>

132,6262bb2b5ff7e757f05369ae,catcatnya.com,False,346,"<p><strong>A general failure to follow the guidelines (&quot;Server rules&quot;) section on the about page will, depending on the severity, lead to the removal of your posts or your account.</strong></p>

<p>Welcome to CatCatNya~! We are an instance hoping to foster a diverse queer community&#39;s presence in the Fediverse, which includes, <strong>but is absolutely not limited to</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>cats</li>
<li>queerness</li>
<li>plurality</li>
<li>disability</li>
<li>anti-racism</li>
</ul>

<p>We are mainly speaking English and German, but other languages are also welcome.</p>

<p>Basically, the only things we exclude is fascists and tankies. <strong>We do not like those.</strong> Authoritarianism is garbage <strong>because</strong> it is detrimental to what&#39;s mentioned above. Yes, even cats. Have you ever seen a cat like authority?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, some authority is required to do moderation and even to host an instance to begin with.</p>

<p>We are meowderated by:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://catcatnya.com/web/@kescher"">@kescher</a> - Foundnya, Hostnya, Nyadmin and Meowderator</li>
<li><a href=""https://catcatnya.com/web/@sk"">@sk</a> - Nyadmin and Meowderator</li>

<p>We offer SSO integration with some services:
- <a href=""https://git.gay"">git.kescher.at</a>, a Forgejo instance
- <a href=""https://git.gay"">git.gay</a>, another Forgejo instance</p>

<h2><a name=""federation-policy""></a> Federation policy</h2>

<p>CatCatNya~ will <em>generally</em> freely federate, however, meowderation is strict. Defederation will occur if harassment occurs, fash/tankies are on the overwhelming majority on an instance, an instance being &quot;free speech&quot;, or if an instance is otherwise deemed an immediate danger to users on CatCatNya~. If an instance does not pose an active threat to its users, but is deemed unmeowderated, it will likely result in a limit. Actions done by remote nyadmins/meowderators are weighed more heavily than individual users.</p>

<p>If your instance uses the UFoI, it will likely be suspended, since the very nature of the UFoI is a malicious pact founded by the admin of qoto.org to stop folks from defederating from them.</p>

<p>If your instance welcomes cops, it will at the very least be limited, but we may suspend.</p>

<p>While our set of guidelines already states that anything illegal in Austria will be blocked, <strong>we feel it is neccessary to highlight that we suspend any instances promoting child sex abuse (&quot;MAPs&quot; and other euphemisms for pedophilia) and zoophilia once we notice them</strong>.</p>

<p>If your instance runs a really old version of a Fedi software and it causes processing issues at our end, your instance may be suspended simply because you don&#39;t keep your software up-to-date at all. You shouldn&#39;t be running Mastodon 2.5.2 anymore. No, 2.7.0 is also not going to cut it.</p>

<h2><a name=""other-info""></a> Other info</h2>

<p>We are running our own fork of glitch-soc, which is also a fork of Mastodon. For more info about glitch-soc, see <a href=""https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs/"">the glitch-soc webpage</a>. For more info about our own fork see <a href=""https://git.kescher.at/CatCatNya/catstodon"">this git repository</a>.</p>

<p>In response to the poor performance of big instances like mastodon.social and mastodon.online, we are implementing the following simple policy: Once we reach around 200 monthly active users, we will disable registrations. We are strongly opposed to the existence of big instances of software for a <strong>decentralized protocol</strong>.</p>

<p>This instance is hosted on the same machine as an Arch mirror. Therefore, the network performance on this instance may vary. This should not be a real issue, considering these server specs:</p>

<p>El equipo de administraci&oacute;n responder&aacute; a cualquier queja tan pronto como sea posible. Si no recibe una respuesta oportuna (por ejemplo, si actualmente no hay administradores en l&iacute;nea), primero ponga su seguridad personal y su bienestar, y considere cerrar sesi&oacute;n.</p>

<p>Este c&oacute;digo de conducta se aplica a los espacios de nuestra comunidad, pero si un miembro de nuestra comunidad le est&aacute; acosando fuera de nuestros espacios, a&uacute;n queremos saberlo. Tomaremos en serio todos los informes de buena fe de acoso por parte de nuestros miembros, especialmente por parte de les administradores. Esto incluye el acoso fuera de nuestros espacios y el acoso que tuvo lugar en cualquier momento. El equipo de abuso se reserva el derecho de excluir a las personas de la comunidad en funci&oacute;n de su comportamiento pasado, incluido el comportamiento fuera de nuestros espacios y el comportamiento hacia las personas que no est&aacute;n en esta comunidad.</p>

<p>Para proteger a los voluntarios del abuso y el agotamiento, nos reservamos el derecho de rechazar cualquier informe que creamos que se haya hecho de mala fe. Los informes destinados a silenciar las cr&iacute;ticas leg&iacute;timas pueden eliminarse sin respuesta.</p>

<p>Proceso</p>

<p>Cada informe de violaci&oacute;n del c&oacute;digo de conducta ser&aacute; tratado con seriedad y cuidado. Si la seguridad inmediata de un miembro se ve amenazada, une administradore individual puede tomar cualquier acci&oacute;n que considere apropiada, incluida la prohibici&oacute;n temporal del acceso para le infractore de la comunidad. En situaciones menos urgentes, al menos une administradore dar&aacute; una respuesta adecuada, que se compartir&aacute; con le infractore en privado. Cualquiera sea la resoluci&oacute;n que decidan, la decisi&oacute;n de les administradores involucrados en un caso de violaci&oacute;n del c&oacute;digo se considerar&aacute; final.</p>

<p>Respetaremos las solicitudes de confidencialidad con el fin de proteger a las v&iacute;ctimas de abuso. A nuestro criterio, podemos nombrar p&uacute;blicamente a una persona sobre la cual hemos recibido quejas de acoso, o advertir en privado a terceros sobre ellas, si creemos que hacerlo aumentar&aacute; la seguridad de nuestros miembros o del p&uacute;blico en general. No nombraremos v&iacute;ctimas de acoso sin su consentimiento.</p>

<p>Consecuencias</p>

<p>Se espera que los participantes a les que se le soliciten detener cualquier comportamiento de acoso lo cumplan de inmediato. Si un participante se involucra en un comportamiento de acoso, los administradores pueden tomar cualquier acci&oacute;n que consideren apropiada, incluida la expulsi&oacute;n de la comunidad e identificaci&oacute;n del participante como acosador para otros miembros. A discreci&oacute;n de los administradores, o por solicitud, una o m&aacute;s de las partes involucradas pueden solicitar discutir la violaci&oacute;n y c&oacute;mo evitar situaciones similares en el futuro.</p>

<p>Wij zijn een initiatief van burgers en ondernemers die een lokale en regionale zelfdragende samenleving bouwen. In deze samenleving maken we gebruik van ieders kwaliteiten en zorgen we ervoor dat iedereen waarde heeft. We realiseren, ondersteunen en onderzoeken lokale initiatieven. Hierbij werken we samen op basis van gelijkwaardigheid, vertrouwen, positiviteit, verbinding en respect.<p>


<h4>Onze droom</h4>
<p>De komende jaren ontstaat een sterke, zelfdragende economie waarin mensen vreedzaam en op een waardige manier met elkaar samenleven. We hebben als burgers steeds meer facetten van het leven in eigen beheer. </p>

<p>Stapje voor stapje gaan we lokaal: je tomaten komen uit Dongen, je stukje vlees uit Chaam en de groenten uit een van de vele Bredase voedselbossen. We nemen het heft in eigen hand. Lees meer hierover in <a href=""https://www.bndestem.nl/breda/met-nieuw-west-brabant-willen-deze-west-brabanders-de-wereld-duurzamer-en-meer-lokaal-maken~ac56a6df/"">dit artikel van BN DeStem</a>. </p>

<h4>Onze werkwijze</h4>
<p>Nieuw West-Brabant faciliteert, stimuleert en ondersteunt bestaande en nieuwe regionale initiatieven. Ze verbindt mensen met vergelijkbare ideeën en werkt in domeinen als Lokaal Ondernemen, Voeding, Gezondheid, Wonen en Lokaal Geld. Deelnemers worden straks lid van de coöperatie en daarmee ook mede-eigenaar van de beweging. </p>

<p>Onder de paraplu van Nieuw West-Brabant worden projecten en pilots opgezet waar leden van kunnen profiteren. Denk aan gezamenlijke inkoop van energie of regionale coöperatieve initiatieven voor voedsel. </p>

<p>We gaan graag de samenwerking aan met lokale politiek en publieke instituties. We bouwen op en zijn constructief. Ook hebben we contact met initiatieven als Society 4.0, Local Economic Forum (LEF) Ede en Vereniging Nieuw Westland. Nieuw West-Brabant opereert zelfstandig en is volledig onafhankelijk.</p>


<h4>Doe mee!</h4>
<p>We werken aan een sterke beweging die verandering initieert en een voortrekkersrol speelt in de creatie van een lokaal geënte economie. Hoe groter de schaal, hoe sterker de nieuwe samenleving. Wees ook een early-adopter. Zonder jou is er geen wij. </p>

We're a general instance full of predominantly queer, nerdy, and furry folk. This place is smaller than similar instances, and thus less chaotic. If you're someone who prefers a quiet corner, you'll find one here. Users here have a wide variety of interests, we have no niche.
<P>
<P>Other instances may have a code of conduct along with a moderation staff to enforce the rules of the community. I've decided not to run this instance that way. On this instance, it's run according to how I want it to run. This doesn't mean it's an unfriendly place or that I rule with an iron fist, it just means that I'm the sole staff person, and that will always be the case. And for rules, they're extremely loose because I like giving people tools to curate their own feeds as opposed to trying to manage everyone's feeds for them. 
<P>
<P>That being said, I'll give you a quick idea of what sort of things I'm looking to keep off the local and federated feeds here so you can know in advance if you'll fit in or not. 

<hr>

<P> - No Nazis, or really any pro fascist, nationalistic hate rhetoric that exists out there
<P> - We're queer friendly here, so any bigots can find themselves the door out of here
<P> - You would think I could just put, ""no racism"" here, but a lot of people haven't figured out how to do that yet so I need to say a bit more about it. I'm a white guy, and for some that's an understandable dealbreaker (no hard feelings), but for others I want to stress that I'm gonna do whatever I can to make sure you're comfortable here within reason. If an instance is harassing you repeatedly, they're gone if you let me know. My bullshit capacity is at a all time low. If an instance doesn't want to action their users for their racist bullshit, then I'm not gonna host them here. If it's coming from one of the users here, they're gone. I'm no nonsense and not here to play games or debate those sort of folks. If it bugs you, it'll probably bug me and I'm gonna take care of it regardless of consequences. I don't give a shit about fediverse relationships. 
<P> - That being said, if you're someone who tends to get into a lot of petty internet spats, and want someone to look out for you on the home instance, you might want to keep looking. I'm not gonna tolerate any user harassing users of different instances or repeatedly getting into fights with people. I have no issues kicking you out if I'm getting a lot of reports about your behavior. If you're the one being harassed however, and it's clearly evident, I will take action for you in that case.
<P> - I have a pretty lax policy when it comes to content warnings. I don't strictly enforce users to use them, but I do encourage people to use them when posting anything that could be potentially triggering for someone. I advocate users using their judgement here, and expect people to use CWs appropriately. I will not force people to use them. I am not omnipresent and don't particularly wish to try to be, so if you see a user not tagging something that is triggering you, I would ask that you just mute them.
<P> - Speaking of muting people, I really do stress the features given to you by the platform. Instead of posting something you know will start an argument with someone, just block them instead. An entire instance of shitposters is bugging you? Block the whole instance on your own instead of asking me to defederate with them or starting shit with them. I'm not here to manage your feeds when people are annoying or tasteless.
<P> - Really, just use common sense. If you act like an adult and treat other people like adults, you'll have no issues here.

<p>Wir möchten allen Wesen, die unsere Welt kreativ gestalten und Neues erschaffen wollen, eine Heimat bieten. Dabei ist uns ein <strong>respektvoller Umgang</strong> wichtig. Daher haben wir uns einige Regeln gegeben, um eine inkusive und kreative Umgebung zu schaffen. Generell aber gilt: <strong>Be excellent to each other!</strong></p>

<p><code>cultur.social</code> steht für eine respektvolle Netzkultur, Verwirklichung von Ideen, kulturelle Werte, Inspiration und Diskurs, den Kampf um eine bessere Welt und vieles mehr.</p>

<h2>Regeln</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Um eine rücksichtsvolle und freundliche Atmosphäre zu schaffen, stehen Wekzeuge zur Verfügung, die konsequent eingesetzt werden sollten. Dazu gehören <strong>Inhaltswarnungen</strong> (insbesondere bei potenziell verstörenden oder kontroversen Themen) und die Verwendung von <strong>Bildbeschreibungen</strong> für Mediendateien.</p></li>

<li><p>Wir tolerieren <strong>keinerlei diskriminierende Inhalte</strong>. Insbesondere Inhalte geeignet sind die Unterdrückung von Mitgliedern von Randgruppen fördern werden nicht geduldet.</p></li>
<li><p>Wir dulden <strong>kein bedrohliches oder belästigendes Verhalten</strong>, enschließlich Doxxing, Stalking, Brigading, Dogpiling oder jede andere Form der ungewollten Kontaktaufnahme mit einer Nutzer*in. Weitehin wird Mobbing, einschließlich Beschimpfungen, absichtlich falsche Geschlechter-Ansprache oder Deadnaming, nicht toleriert.</p></li>
<li><p>Nationalistische <strong>Propaganda</strong>, Nazi-Symbolik, die Förderung der Ideologie des Nationalsozialismus, Verschwörungserzählungen sind hier nicht erwünscht.</p></li>
<li><p>Wir dulden <strong>Bots nur in engen Grenzen</strong> und in Absprache mit den Admins. Bots müssen immer eindeutig als solche markiert werden. Automatisierte Beiträge sollten immer als &quot;Nicht gelistet&quot; gepostet werden. Damit sorgen wir für eine lokale Timeline die dem Austausch untereinander dient.</p></li>
<li><p>Sämtliche verfügbaren Daten (inklusive der Inhalte, Medien und Metadaten) auf <code>cultur.social</code> dürfen nicht für maschinelles Lernen oder andere &quot;Forschungszwecke&quot; verwendet werden. Ausnahmen sind nur mit ausdrücklicher Zustimmung der involvierten Nutzer*innen gestattet. Die Admins sind in jedem Fall vorab zu informieren.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Spam ist nicht gestattet</strong>. Spam-Konten werden nach dem Ermessen der Moderator*innen gelöscht.</p></li>
<li><p>Augenscheinliche <strong>Fake-Konten</strong> (Impersonation) von Personen und Institionen können nach dem Ermessen der Moderator*innen markiert, gesperrt oder unter Umständen auch gelöscht werden.</p></li>
<li><p>Diese Instanz darf <strong>nicht zur Verbreitung von Pornografie</strong> bzw. sexuell expliziter Texte, Bilder, Videos und sonstigen Medien genutzt werden. Potentiell anstößige Inhalte ausserhalb dieser Definition müssen mit einer entsprechenden Inhaltswarnung versehen werden. Hierbei gilt: Inhalte lieber einmal zu Oft taggen, als einmal zu wenig. Accounts, die überwiegend oder ausschließlich der Verbreitung von &quot;NSFW&quot;-Inhalten dienen können durch die Moderator*innen entsprechend markiert werden. In extremen Fällen kann eine Löschung erfolgen.</p></li>
<li><p>Inaktive bzw. leere Konten (keine Posts, Follower, Following) können nach einer angemessenen Frist entfernt werden.</p></li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Bitte melde ein Verhalten, welches dich stört. Wir werden deine Meldung vertraulich behandeln.</strong></p>

<p>Wenn bei einer Meldung zu einem potentiellen Verstoß gegen diese Regeln weitere Untersuchungen erfordern um eine Entscheidung herbei zu führen, behalten sich die Moderator*innen das Recht vor, sofort zu handeln, um potenzielle Opfer von Fehlverhalten und die Gemeinschaft zu schützen.</p>

<p>Die Kommunikation zum Zwecke der Moderation ist <strong>in deutscher oder englischer Sprache</strong> möglich. Jegliche Meldungen, Einsprüche und Begründungen in anderen Sprachen müssen wir ablehnen, da die Sprachbarriere eine fundierte Entscheidung bei uneindeutiger Sachlage unmöglich macht. Im Zweifel sehen wir uns in solchen Fällen dem Schutz der Gemeinschaft verprflichtet.</p>

Un fantasma recorre Europa... y es el fantasma del frikismo. En estos tiempos donde las grandes cadenas de ropa tienen pijamas de Spiderman o sudaderas de Naruto, o Disney se compra Star Wars, los frikis se distinguen porque comparten, comentan y divulgan sus aficiones.
<br>
<br>
En el Frikiverse queremos ser sobre todo una instancia multitemática, donde #frikis de todas las tendencias hablemos sobre nuestras aficiones y aprendamos de las aficiones de los otros, pero también un punto de encuentro donde podamos compartir las cosas que nos pasan en la #SagaRealidad. No pretendemos que sólo se hable de cosas frikis, sino también que haya frikis hablando de sus cosas. 
<br>
<br>
En el Frikiverse nos gusta hablar de #libros, #cómics, #ilustración, #series, #cine, #manga, #anime, #música o cualquier otro soporte de transmisión de la #Cultura. Pero también de aficiones, más o menos afines, como la #astronomía, la #informática y la #tecnología, el #rol y los #juegosDeMesa, los #juegos de ordenador o de consola, la #física y las #matemáticas, la #historia, la #mitología, el #arte, los #idiomas y la #lingüística, la #fotografía, destinos mágicos (como #Japón o #Bretaña) y muchas otras. Si alguna vez te han llamado friki por dedicar mucho tiempo a una afición, esta es tu casa. 
<br>
<br>
Nuestro objetivo es ser una instancia &quot;pequeña&quot;, donde pueda haber un sentimiento de comunidad. Nos gustaría llegar a ser unos pocos centenares de usuarios activos. Para aumentar el contenido disponible, y la difusión de nuestras publicaciones, estamos en el <a href=""https://relay.tkz.one"">relay.tkz.one</a> junto a otras instancias en castellano. También usamos relays de lectura específicos con instancias afines como xarxa.cloud o paquita.masto.host.
<br>
<br>
Nuestra política de moderación pretende mantener un espacio del Fediverse que sea seguro e inclusivo, con la mínima moderación posible, pero con toda la moderación necesaria. Como instancia, nos comprometemos a cumplir los criterios establecidos en el <a href=""https://joinmastodon.org/es/covenant"">Mastodon Server Covenant</a>.

Zusammen mit einem liebenswerten Moderationsteam betreibe ich diese Instanz um es Creatorn zu ermöglichen die Vorteile der Twitter Alternative Mastodon zu nutzen.
<br>Falls Fragen bestehen, könnt ihr euch jederzeit an unsere Mail wenden. Wir helfen euch gerne weiter. 🙂</p>

<p>Mit einer großen Creator Community, welche als Vorbild agiert, können wir genau das erreichen und Follower auf Mastodon aufmerksam machen, zusätzlich innerhalb der Community können wir coole Events und Projekte umsetzen.</p>

<h2>Finanzierung</h2>

<p>Unsere Instanz wird komplett ehrenamtlich moderiert und administriert, sowie die monatlichen Domain- und Serverkosten eigens bezahlt.</p>

<p><h3>Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct</h3><p>

<p><strong>Our Pledge</strong>

<p>In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

<p><strong>Our Standards</strong>

<p>Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:
<ul>
<li>Using welcoming and inclusive language</li>
<li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</li>
<li>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</li>
<li>Focusing on what is best for the community</li>
<li>Showing empathy towards other community members</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
<p><ul>
<li>The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances</li>
<li>Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks</li>
<li>Public or private harassment</li>
<li>Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic
address, without explicit permission</li>
<li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
professional setting</li>
</ul><p>

<p>All toots (public and private) should abide by the following rules:</p>

<p><ul><li>Do not post any illegal content, including sexual depictions of children, or any other content illegal in the United States.</li>
<li>Do not use slurs or racist, sexist, genderist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory or hateful jokes or language or promote white supremacy, anti-Semitism, transphobia or other hateful ideologies.</li>
<li>Do not harass anyone, participate in group harassment of anyone, or otherwise engage in personal attacks.</li>
<li>Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”) constitutes harassment.</li>
<li>Do not be intentionally antagonistic. A post or reply designed to provoke a confrontation is not acceptable.</li>
<li>Do not post adult content without a content warning, including pictures containing nudity, or unwelcome sexual attention (including sexualized comments or jokes).</li>
<li>Do not spread disinformation or conspiracy theories that undermine public health. Healthy scientific debate is allowed but baseless, harmful conspiracies will not be tolerated.</li>
<li>Holocaust denial, Nazi symbolism, and promotion of National Socialism is strictly forbidden.</li>
<li>Do not post spam. Toots that are nothing other than a link and/or contain an inordinate number of hashtags constitute spam, as does any overly commercial self-promotion. (It is fine, however, to toot about your own projects and share what you are excited to be working on — just keep the toot itself interesting).</li>
<li>Do not use automated tools to toot without participating in the community, without explicit permission from the the administrator and/or moderators of vermont.masto.host. It is fine to post with an automated tool (e.g., a Twitter cross-poster) so long as you are an active member of the vermont.masto.host community and respond to replies you receive here. However, unmonitored accounts that post automatically are not acceptable.</li></p>

<p><strong>Our Responsibilities</strong></p>

<p><p>Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.</p>

<p><p>Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.</p>

<p><p><strong>Scope</strong></p>

<p><p>This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.</p>

<p><p>Examples of representing a project or community include using an official
project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting
as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of
a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.</p>

<p><p><strong>Enforcement</strong></p>

<p><p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at brendankinney AT gmail.com. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.</p>

<p><p>Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project’s leadership.</p>

<p><p><strong>Attribution</strong></p>

<p><p>This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4,
available at <a href=""https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html"">https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html</a></p>

<p>Welcome to The Body Social, a small community dedicated to naked content creators and activists looking for a space to explore and share simple, non-sexual nudity inside the fediverse.</p>

<h2>Audience</h2>

<p>Mastodon and the fediverse, collectively, encompass around 11 million users and around 1.8 million active users per month (source: <a href=""https://fedidb.org/"" target=""__blank"">FediDB</a>). Our community is intentionally small, but has access to 25,000 other communities which can be seamlessly followed and posted to from the comfort of The Body Social.</p>

<h2>Moderation</h2>

<p>Keeping a safe space for naked content creators requires moderation that can't commonly be found in larger communities. We're here to treat our members with care and help them grow by moderating from a philosophy compatible with their own.</p>

<h2>Our beliefs</h2>

<ul>
  <li>You only get one body, so enjoy it</li>
  <li>Be in tune with your body on a deeper level</li>
  <li>Health and happiness above the expectations of others</li>
  <li>Unwind the association of sexuality and nudity</li>
  <li>Clothing is optional and that choice shouldn't diminish your dignity</li>
</ul>

<h2>Naturism</h2>

<p>A lot of our members tend to come with a background in naturism. You can read more about that at <a href=""https://naturism.is"">naturism.is</a>.</p>

<h2>Our service promise to you</h2>

<p>Our top priorities are to keep your data backed up and safe and your experience here seamless and uninterrupted.</p>

<h2>How we're funded</h2>

<p>The Body Social is self-funded at the moment and not seeking any funding. This may change in the future as we explore options, such as obtaining non-profit member organization status.</p>

This includes research neuroscientists in academia and industry as well as artists, educators, students, and others who are exploring neuroscience in their life and work.</p>

<p>Although this server is focused on neuroscience, you&#39;re open to post about other topics of interest as well. The vibe of this server is a cafe conversation, where the topic might shift from fly connectomics to issues in psychiatry to shared knitting hobbies. Let&#39;s get to know each other!</p>

<li>Share your discoveries</li>
<li>Share your work-in-progress</li>
<li>Talk about your experiences learning or applying neuroscience</li>
<li>Share summaries of articles you&#39;ve read</li>
<li>Discuss current issues in neuroscience</li>
<li>Discuss relevant issues in academia and industry</li>
</ul>

<h1>Longevity of the server</h1>

<p>We commit to maintaining this server for the foreseeable future. The server itself is hosted on a computer through Hertzner which is backed up daily to prevent data loss.
We can cover the current server costs (about $50 / month), but if the server needs to scale further we will ask for donations. We currently anticipate maintaining this server for years. However, in the case that we need to close the server down, we will provide at least 3 months notice to give you time to migrate.</p>

<h1>Domain blocking policy</h1>

<p>Our goal in blocking domains is to reduce attacks on users as well as remove hateful content from the federated timeline. We will add new domains to the block list by monitoring #fediblock, the block lists of similar servers, and based on user reports.</p>

<h3>What Khiar is</h3>

<li>A place for discussion, community and friendly interactions of all kinds</li>
<li>A place to make friends.</li>
<li>A place to share what you’re excited about, things you enjoy and things you don’t.</li>
<li>A general platform with no real subject or topic that tries to foster an environment where everyone can be included.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>What Khiar is not</h3>
<div class=""outline-text-3"" id=""text-1-2"">
<ul class=""org-ul"">
<li>A place to promote your ideology or politics.</li>
<li>A safe-haven for all speech.</li>

<div id=""outline-container-org766a72a"" class=""outline-3"">
<h3> Rules for All Toots</h3>
<div class=""outline-text-3"" id=""text-1-3"">
<p>
All toots (public and private) should abide by the following rules:
</p>
<ul class=""org-ul"">
<li>Do not post extreme adult content.</li>
<li>Adult-themed humor is permitted so long it is not directed towards an individual.</li>
<li>Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) is not permitted. Any attempt to sexualize children (anyone under the age of 18) is also not permitted.</li>
<li>Content illegal in the United Kingdom is not allowed and will result in revocation of access.</li>
<li>Any hate speech or discrimination of any group of people, nationality, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation is not tolerated and will result in immediate moderator action.</li>
<li>Do not engage in personal attacks, all disagreements and arguments must remain civil. There will always be a difference in opinions, we must learn to respect that.</li>
<li>Do not engage in back-seat moderation. If you see any inappropriate behavior or violations of this CoC, refrain from engaging and report the offending toot.</li>
<li>Do not spam or post commercial advertisements.</li>
<li>Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”) is prohibited.</li>
<li>Any depiction of extreme violence content is out of bound and will result in moderator action.</li>
<li>Bots are not allowed unless given explicit permission from the moderation team.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p></div></p>

<div id=""outline-container-org74fa5d1"" class=""outline-3"">
<h3> Rules for Public Toots</h3>
<div class=""outline-text-3"" id=""text-1-4"">
<p>
Public toots should follow the above rules and should also abide by the following additional rules. Your boosts (reblogs) are also considered as public toots:
</p>
<ul class=""org-ul"">
<li>Do not debate moderation actions in public toots. If you disagree with how a moderator enforced this CoC you may direct-message the moderation team.</li>
<li>Any mild adult content must include a “content warning”.</li>
<li>Do not toot in languages other than English and Farsi.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p></div></p>

<div id=""outline-container-org7d4fdcd"" class=""outline-3"">
<h3> Reporting Violations</h3>
<div class=""outline-text-3"" id=""text-1-5"">
<p>
If you notice a toot that violates this code of conduct, please report it. It is easy to assume that someone else has already reported a toot, but it is easy for everyone to feel that way and no one to report the toot. If you feel personally uncomfortable with the kind of attention you’re receiving, please reach out to the moderation team.
</p>
</div>

<p></div></p>

<div id=""outline-container-org92774fa"" class=""outline-3"">
<h3> Catch-all</h3>
<div class=""outline-text-3"" id=""text-1-6"">
<p>
The moderation team will always take a pragmatic approach to every report they receive - if they feel that a problematic Toot isn’t explicitly called out in this CoC, yet is inappropriate for Khiar, the Toot will likely be removed, and the member will be dealt with appropriately.
</p>
</div>

<p></div></p>

<div id=""outline-container-org33e4817"" class=""outline-3"">
<h3> Registration</h3>
<div class=""outline-text-3"" id=""text-1-7"">
<p>
Registration on Khiar is approval-based. Everyone’s allowed to fill out a registration form, but with an additional form entry for mentioning why you want to join. It is advisable to write a brief introductory paragraph in the registration form.

<li><h3>Don&#39;t be a jerk.</h3> This can be open to interpretation, but for the most part common sense should prevail, which means none of the following is allowed: racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia (including purposeful misgendering/deadnaming), ableism, classism, bigotry, harassment, doxxing, or just generally targeted meanness. This isn&#39;t necessarily an exhaustive list, but a good rule of thumb is: PodVibes = Good Vibes.</li>
<li><h3>Content warnings exist for a reason. Use them.</h3> A wide variety of things can trigger trauma, and it can be tough to ensure you&#39;re capturing them all. Put in a good faith effort and be open to feedback is all we ask. And, to be clear, this is generally a firm suggestion more than a hard rule.</li>
<li><h3>No illegal shenanigans.</h3> Comply with all local laws, regulations, and ordinances. Do not discuss or attempt to organize any illegal activities on this website.</li>
<li><h3>To join this server you must be 18+.</h3> Some audio fiction content may deal with adult themes. To ensure we are complying with laws and avoiding angry parents, we require all users to be at least 18 years of age.</li>

<p><strong>Raphus Social</strong> 🦤 is a better bird site. It is a place for bringing together open minded people interested in technology, open source, tabletop games, and other general geekery.<br>
Named after the extinct Dodo bird, <em>Raphus Cucullatus</em>. As one bird site is falling apart, we found it only fitting that this server be named in honor of another bird destroyed by human arrogance. </p>

<h1>Moderation</h1>

<p>This server strives to be a safe and inclusive environment, and is actively moderated in accordance with the rules of this server, (for more details, please see the <a href=""https://raphus.social/coc.html"">Raphus Social Code of Conduct</a>), and the <a href=""https://joinmastodon.org/covenant"">Mastodon Server Covenant</a>.  </p>

<p><em>Note: BirdsiteLive instances are blocked. These so-called &quot;ethical bridges from Twitter&quot; end up creating &quot;duplicate accounts&quot; of people by pulling in their twitter content (without the author&#39;s permission or consent). They are limited by Twitter&#39;s api, get overloaded, become unreliable, and ultimately stop working. Because of these problems, they would cause an excessive drain on resources.</em>  </p>

<h2>Defederation Policy</h2>

<p>We actively defederate from other servers that are incompatible with our fundamental rules and may pose a risk to our users. The decision to defederate can come from reports by our users, community discussions about bad actors, and through the use of shared blocklists. User safety is always our number one concern, so we will proactively block problematic servers rather than wait for abuse to happen.<br>
We also employ <code>AUTHORIZED_FETCH</code> (aka “Secure Mode”) to ensure that our users posts do not unknowingly end up on blocked servers.<br>
<em>We do not currently share our blocklist publicly due to the presence of offensive language and illegal content, but will be made available to current users upon request.</em>  </p>

<h3>Threads.net</h3>

<p><em>Meta’s policies on moderation, user safety, and privacy are not compatible with our own, so we have no intention to enable federation with Threads if/when it does become fully implemented.</em></p>

<p>Poliversity è una comunità Mastodon italiana dedicata all'università, alla ricerca, alla scuola e al giornalismo. Promuoviamo il Diritto alla Conoscenza e la corretta informazione: è aperta a ricercatori, giornalisti, operatori dell'informazione, fotoreporter, bibliotecari, archivisti, studenti ed educatori di tutti i livelli, editor, tecnologi, dirigenti di istituzioni scolastiche e chiunque sia coinvolto nel mondo dell'istruzione e del giornalismo.<br/>
Poliversity è uno spin-off di Poliverso.org e de LeAlternative.net<br/>
La comunità è focalizzata sull'ambiente accademico, scientifico, scolastico e su quello dell'informazione e del giornalismo.<br/>
In un momento in cui la cultura scientifica e il mondo dell'informazione sembrano assediati dalla disinformazione, le fake news e il pensiero magico, Poliversity vorrebbe diventare una sorta di piazza accademica del Fediverso italiano per la promozione dell'incontro tra conoscenza e informazione.</p>

<p>I nomi reali e le credenziali sono consigliati solo se vorrai utilizzare il tuo account su questa istanza con l'obiettivo di fare rete, ma non sono assolutamente obbligatori.</p>

<h5>Come puoi usare Poliversity</h5>

<ul>
<li>Utilizza la lingua italiana quando possibile, ma quando preferisci rivolgerti a una platea internazionale sei libero di usare la lingua che preferisci</li>
<li>Raccontaci delle tue pubblicazioni, dei tuoi articoli o dei contributi interessanti che hai letto</li>
<li>Condividi riferimenti e risorse</li>
<li>Fai rete con altri accademici, studenti e giornalisti</li>
<li>Inserisci il link a poliversity.it nell'ultima diapositiva delle tue presentazioni o delle tue conferenze</li>
<li>La satira è ammessa, ma non deve essere utilizzata per bullizzare gli altri, soprattutto se più deboli; l'attivismo e la politica sono da sempre parte dell'ambiente accademico, scientifico e giornalistico, ma qui dentro non possono assumere un peso preponderante e soprattutto non devono essere utilizzate per ragioni identitarie</li>
<li>I contenuti non accademici e ""off topic"" sono consentiti, ma ricorda sempre che è possibile pubblicarli con l'opzione di visibilità ""Non in elenco"" e non ""Pubblico""</li>
</ul>

<h5>Chi è il benvenuto su Fediversity?<br/>
Devo essere uno studente, un insegnante, un giornalista o un ricercatore a tempo pieno?</h5>

<p>No, ma ricorda che i ""temi"" più importanti per questa istanza sono: il diritto alla conoscenza, il mondo dell'informazione, il mondo accademico, la ricerca, l'insegnamento e l'apprendimento, che sono naturalmente argomenti molto ampi.<br/>
Non è necessario un diploma avanzato o risultare in un qualche albo per iscriversi (né qualsiasi altro titolo).</p>

<p>Se ti consideri uno studioso di qualsiasi tipo o uno studente o un giornalista e sei disposto a impegnarti con gli altri rispettosamente e rispetterai gli sforzi della nostra comunità per rendere questo uno spazio sicuro per le persone queer e altre minoranze, sarai il benvenuto.</p>

<p>Questa istanza vuole fornire uno spazio sicuro per le persone queer, altre minoranze nel mondo accademico e giornalisti indipendenti. A causa del rapporto antagonistico che le forze dell'ordine hanno spesso avuto con questi gruppi, gli agenti di polizia e i dipendenti di qualsiasi polizia o agenzia di intelligence non sono i benvenuti in questa istanza a meno che, dichiarandosi come tali, non svolgano attività di ricerca scientifica, docenza presso scuole superiori, università o master, oppure stiano frequentando corsi universitari o post-universitari.<br/>

<h5>Avvisi sui contenuti (Content Warning: CW)</h5>

<p>Si prega di aggiungere CW (avvisi di contenuto) che siano sufficientemente accurati e descrittivi da consentire il consenso del lettore ai post che potrebbero essere disturbanti. Non è possibile stilare una regola universale, perché questi contenuti possono essere percepiti diversamente a seconda delle sensibilità. Di solito basterebbe attenersi alle regole della buona educazione, ma bisogna prestare particolare attenzione quando si ha a che fare con:</p>

sproloqui,<br/>
selfie decontestualizzati,<br/>
eventi attuali (si può parlare di attualità, ma questa istanza non è un'agenzia di stampa!),<br/>
questioni altamente conflittuali o comunque estenuanti del dibattito popolare (ad es. cambiamento climatico, OGM, questioni relative alla privacy, elezioni, ecc.),<br/>
menzioni di morte o violenza,<br/>
riferimenti o collegamenti alle piattaforme proprietarie,<br/>
spoiler di programmi TV popolari e recenti o altri media,<br/>
ASCII art (questo è importante per garantire che qualcuno che utilizza uno screen reader non debba ascoltare un tentativo di leggere un mucchio di caratteri privi di significato testuale),<br/>
se possibile è meglio contrassegnare allo stesso modo contenuti che riguardano voti, esami, avanzamento della tesi, prospettive del mercato del lavoro accademico e qualsiasi altra cosa in cui un altro utente potrebbe voler decidere da solo se o quando desidera interagire con il tuo post.</p>

<p>C'è un'impostazione nelle tue preferenze per contrassegnare automaticamente tutti i tuoi post con Content Warning, se non vuoi contrassegnarli ogni volta.</p>

<h5>Descrizioni delle immagini</h5>

<p>È un'aspettativa di questa istanza che tu aggiunga una descrizione alle immagini e ai video che pubblichi per facilitare l'accessibilità.<br/>
E no, una descrizione come ""image.jpg"" non aiuta nell'accessibilità :-)</p>

<p>Se pubblichi un'immagine di uno screenshot di testo, è un'aspettativa di questa istanza che trascrivi il testo nella descrizione dell'immagine.</p>

<h5>La timeline locale</h5>

<p>Sii consapevole di quanto spazio occupi sulla timeline locale. Questa è come una ""bacheca"" dell'istanza, dove tutti vedono e guardano tutti.</p>

<p>I post sulla timeline locale (quelli con l'impostazione sulla privacy ""Pubblico"") verranno controllati per garantire che gli avvisi sui contenuti vengano applicati dove necessario, che le immagini siano descritte e che vengano seguite le altre indicazioni. I post non in elenco non verranno esaminati in modo proattivo, ma saranno comunque soggetti a regole in materia di abusi e altri incitamenti all'odio.</p>

<p>Un consiglio che ci teniamo a dare è di contrassegnare il primo post di una discussione come ""Pubblico"" e i post successivi come ""Non in elenco"". Ad esempio, consigliamo vivamente un thread per rendre conto di una conferenza o un seminario.</p>

<p>Se preferisci pubblicare post lunghi, prendi in considerazione l'ipotesi di aprire un account solo o anche su poliverso.org che è un'istanza basata su friendica. Per creare post lunghi puoi anche prendere in considerazione l'iscrizione alla piattaforma feddit.it, basata su Lemmy, nella quale puoi pubblicare post visibili in tutto il fediverso e strutturati come thread sul modello dei subreddit. Su feddit.it esistono già alcun comunità come ""Scienza"", ""Arte"", ""Notizie"" e ""Libri"", e se opportuno puoi chiedere agli amministratori di aprire nuove comunità.</p>

<p>NOTA: Sì, lo sappiamo: le prime versioni dell'app Mastodon ""ufficiale"" non consentono la pubblicazione utilizzando l'impostazione della privacy ""Non in elenco"".</p>

<p>Usa un CW se non sei sicuro che il tuo post sia ""in tema"".<br/>
Poliversity non è pensato per essere un aggregatore di notizie di attualità e se il tuo post sembra rientrare in questa categoria, ti potrebbe essere chiesto di eliminarlo e riformularlo con un CW, come un post non elencato: ricorda ch puoi sempre utilizzare sistemi basati sulla pubblicazione di notizie come Feddit.it.<br/>
Non vogliamo trasformare la timeline locale in una brutta copia di Twitter!</p>

<p>Fai del tuo meglio per cercare di accontentarti a vicenda e cerca di essere comprensivo quando c'è uno scontro di aspettative o bisogni. I MODERATORI DELL'ISTANZA CERCHERANNO DI ESSERE COMUNQUE COMPRENSIVI E TOLLERANTI VERSO I NUOVI UTENTI</p>

<h5>Comportamento sgradito su Poliversity</h5>

<p>Ciò comporterà: un consiglio da parte dei moderatori, un avvertimento ufficiale o, nei casi peggiori, la cancellazione di post offensivi, eventualmente senza preavviso.</p>

<p>Fornire consigli non richiesti a estranei,<br/>
Post inappropriati non CW sulla timeline locale (vedi sopra per le politiche CW),<br/>
Post con immagini o video non descritti,<br/>
Collegamenti abbreviati, ad esempio bit.ly, t.ly, tinyurl.com, goo.gl, ift.tt, lnkd.in, is.gd o t.co (questi sono considerati dannosi perché i link-shortener tracciano gli utenti senza il loro consenso e oscurare l'indirizzo di destinazione, impedendo anche agli utenti di poter decidere se vogliono visitare il link in anticipo),<br/>
Pubblicità o pretesti per pubblicizzare criptovalute, NFT o schemi di marketing multilevel.</p>

<p>Eccezioni:<br/>
I link DOI (ad es. https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.k959) sono consentiti ma sarebbe opportuno descrivere accuratamente il titolo/autore/rivista per consentire al lettore di decidere autonomamente se desidera seguire il link. (In caso di titoli molto lunghi, è possibile troncarlo e, in caso di elenchi di autori lunghi, ""First-Author et al"".) Post con collegamenti DOI in cui l'obiettivo del collegamento non è descritto o non è descritto a sufficienza, possono essere cancellati senza preavviso.</p>

<h5>Cose che faranno chiudere il tuo account, anche senza preavviso</h5>

<ul>
<li>Fascismo, razzismo, sessismo, omofobia, transfobia, abilismo, ecc. (si tradurrà in un divieto permanente, potresti non ricevere un preavviso)</li>
<li>Grave scorrettezza che ferisce gli altri (ad es. rappresentarsi falsamente come un membro di una minoranza; servizi offerti per scrivere documenti accademici per aiutare gli studenti a imbrogliare; negazionismo sui vaccini; conferenze o riviste predatorie; pseudoscienza palese come terrapiattista ecc.)</li>
<li>Tutto ciò che potrebbe essere descritto come ""spam""</li>
<li>Impersonare altre persone</li>
<li>Molestie di ogni tipo</li>
<li>Niente bot e niente account ""istituzionali non ufficiali"" gestiti da non membri per favore; Poliversity è per le persone. Se vuoi gestire un account ""non ufficiale"" puoi creare un account friendica su Poliverso.org</li>
<li>Gli account collegati a twitter che ripubblicano automaticamente i retweet: considera che profili che si limitano a ripubblicare un account Twitter, feed RSS e così via, non sono graditi e se possibile devono pubblicare su Poliversity come non in elenco, non pubblico. Valuteremo volta per volta questo tipo di comportamenti, ma ricorda che non stiamo pagando questo spazio per farlo riempire con cose che provengono da twitter</li>
</ul>

<h5>Sui tentativi di abusare di questi strumenti e politiche anti-abuso</h5>

<p>Ricorda che le segnalazioni si fanno sui contenuti e sui comportamenti e non sulle persone. Prima di segnalare un contenuto valuta se si tratta di una questione di interesse dell'istanza o se non ti basta silenziare quell'utente! Ripetute segnalazioni pretestuose possono portare alla chiusura dell'account che le produce.</p>

<p>Non tentare di armare i nostri standard comunitari o strumenti/politiche anti-abuso contro gruppi emarginati come persone di colore, donne o persone omosessuali. Ci si aspetta che gli utenti di Poliversity abbiano l'alfabetizzazione per capire che la ""discriminazione inversa"" non è reale, e quindi i tentativi di ricentrare le discussioni delle persone emarginate attorno ai sentimenti dei privilegiati saranno considerati un comportamento manipolativo intrapreso deliberatamente in malafede . (Ad esempio, i bianchi non dovrebbero chiedere che le persone di colore mettano CW in ogni discussione sulla razza; una persona etero che denuncia una persona omosessuale per aver scritto ""Non sopporto le persone eterosessuali"" potrebbe vedere sospeso il proprio account.)<br/>

253,637b2e3bd94dca7f11e7af0a,fandom.garden,False,294,"<h2>What is Fandom Garden?</h2>

<p>In Fandom Garden, you are free to gush about the fandoms you like, whether they're related to books, comics, TV shows, movies or music. Come and find fellow fans to share your passion with!</p>

<p>This is a queer, anti-racist, anti-ableist space. We do not tolerate any hateful, discriminatory or bigoted behavior towards any oppressed group (including but not limited to people who are disabled, fat, Jewish, neurodivergent, queer, trans, people of color, sex workers, etc.). We aims to be a sex-positive instance, with a strong opt-in culture for adult content. Our main language is English, and you need to be at least 13 years old to sign up.</p>

<h2>Want to join us?</h2>

<p>FanDen is a small instance and we try to keep it that way so that everybody can know each other, and for this reason we have currently closed registrations. However, if you really want to get in, you can still send us an email or ask someone on the instance for an invite!</p>

<p>Tell us why you want to join our instance specifically, when there are so many different options on Mastodon! You can tell us about your current fandoms, about your online communities, and even share other social media accounts if you feel like it.</p>

<p>Some good practice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Talk about your fandoms.</li>
  <li>Confirm your email address.</li>
  <li>Remember that actual human beings will read and consider your application.</li>
</ul>

<h2>More about fandoms</h2>

<p>We are aware that fandoms can be toxic, but we hope to foster a good environment rather than an abusive one. We believe that you can enjoy content that has flaws (or was made by flawed creators) without glorifying said flaws (or flawed creators). Always prefer <a href=""https://diversity.tufts.edu/resources/interrupting-bias-calling-out-vs-calling-in/"">calling in</a> rather than calling out, and never harass fellow fans over their interests: if they are breaking our rules, for instance by promoting hate speech, simply report them.</p>

<p>The same goes for writing about fictional abuse and abusive relationships: we recognize the need for this content to exist, but since it is a hurtful topic for a lot of people, proceed with caution, do not glorify known abusers and use content warnings as much as possible.</p>

<p>Do not hesitate to make your experience of this instance more comfortable by muting fandoms, characters or topics that you don't want to see in your feed! The same goes with users, nobody should hold it against you if you mute or block them.</p>

<h2 id=""moderation"">Moderation</h2>

<p>We are a safe instance first, and a fandom instance second. We especially do not tolerate any hateful, discriminatory or bigoted behavior towards any oppressed group. In addition to the rules below, we also agree with the rules of trusted instances <a href=""https://info.eldritch.cafe/"">eldritch.cafe</a>, <a href=""https://solarpunk.moe/about/"">solarpunk.moe</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/weirderearth/weirder-rules/blob/main/rules-and-etiquette.md/"">weirder.earth</a>. </p>

<p>The instance's moderation is taken care of voluntarily by the administrators. There are currently three moderators: <a href=""https://fandom.garden/@ariel"">@ariel</a>, <a href=""https://fandom.garden/@ikol"">@ikol</a> and <a href=""https://fandom.garden/@rainbowhalo"">@rainbowhalo</a>. Together they speak Dutch, English, Finnish, French, and Italian. All of them are white. Obviously they will have oversights as white people, but they strive to create an environment that not only says it won't tolerate racism, but an environment where racism cannot thrive.</p>

<p>Together they enforce the rules of the instance. To that end, they are free to use all the tools at their disposal: reports, sending DMs or emails, mutes, blocks.</p>

<p>Our usual process is: delete the reported message, call in the person in private, mute them in the meantime, and if they don't back down or don't respond within a week (or sooner if we see that they've posted messages in the meantime), we ban them. If this happens to be a user of another instance, we reach out to their admins to make sure they take similar measures, and otherwise we consider taking actions towards the whole instance.</p>

<p>We preemptively block any instance we come across that badly contradicts our rules or policies, as well as those which lack consistent moderation. We try our best to communicate, but we don’t negotiate with trolls. If you think an instance should be blocked, please contact our moderation team by reporting any account of that instance or by sending a DM to <a rel=""me"" href=""https://fandom.garden/@gardener"">@gardener</a>.</p>

<p>We have turned on the AUTHORIZED_FETCH option. This means that toots made on Fandom Garden will not be federated to blocked instances (through people boosting them for instance).</p>

<p>In order to declutter the instance, we take actions to delete any account that has been inactive for more than six (6) months: we send two warning emails first, three weeks from one another, and if these haven't gotten any reply we delete or deactivate the account.</p>

<p>You can support the instance by helping with the server costs on <a href=""https://liberapay.com/fandom.garden/"">Liberapay</a>.</p>

<h2>Endorsed Instances</h2>

<p>The following is a list of instances that we have historically been on good terms with, are communities we think are nifty, and we trust have good moderation. We feel comfortable recommending them to others.</p>

<ul>
<li>blackqueer.life, a community for all Black queer, trans, and gender nonconforming people.</li>
<li>cathode.church, an instance dedicated to trans and gender-diverse makers, coders and tinkerers.</li>
<li>cloudisland.nz, a community of people in Aotearoa New Zealand.</li>
<li>dragonscave.space, a small dragon-themed community of mostly visually impaired folks.</li>
<li>old.mermaid.town, another small and well-moderated instance.</li>
<li>solarpunk.moe, a small, friendly server run by a group of optimistically-utopian LGBT+ individuals.

<h2>Recommendation: Content Warnings</h2>
<p>Content warnings are inbuilt in Mastodon, meaning there is a ""CW"" button that hides the content of a post under a ""show more"".</p>

<p>As a general rule, before you post a message, ask yourself whether everybody wants to see what you have posted without warning. Maybe your message will trigger a panic attack for some people? Maybe some folks read Mastodon among their family or at work, and don’t want to see graphic images appear suddenly on their screen?</p>

<p>Having a content warning allows others to <em>choose</em> to confront themselves with topics that can be hard for them, instead of having these topics forced upon them.</p>

<p>Some people also use the CW field as announcement or as title for the topic of their post, or to say that their toot is long: that way, the toot is folded and doesn’t clutter the feed.</p>

<p>A non-exclusive list of topics for which you should use CWs is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Spoilers</li>
  <li>Sexual content, sex, lewd</li>
  <li>Gore, violence</li>
  <li>Politics, religion, discrimination (racism, sexism, antisemitism…)</li>
  <li>Mental health: depression, suicide, usual phobias, negative thoughts, rants…</li>
  <li>Physical health: medical topics, diets…</li>
  <li>Common addictions: alcohol, cigarettes, drugs…</li>
  <li>Food: you can specify whether it's kosher, vegetarian, vegan…</li>
  <li>Violence: physical &amp; mental abuse, toxic relationships…</li>
  <li>Weapons: guns, blades…</li>
  <li>Flashing pieces of media</li>
  <li>Caps: contains at least one word written in capital letters</li>
  <li>Media without alternative text</li>
  <li>Long posts</li>
  <li>Upsetting ships (eg incest, big age gap, abusive relationships, RPF…)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recommendation: Screen Reader Accessibility</h2>

<p>To make sure that everyone is provided with the tools they need to participate fully in our community, here are some collective habits that we should adopt:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Alt-text your images. If you are not in a position to do so, please use <a href=""https://fandom.garden/tags/Alt4Me"" class=""mention hashtag status-link"" rel=""tag"">#<span>Alt4Me</span></a> and someone from the community should be able to help and provide it. More on this in the next section.</li>
  <li>Use PascalCase for the hashtags. Example: <a href=""https://fandom.garden/tags/FandomGarden"" class=""mention hashtag status-link"" rel=""tag"">#<span>FandomGarden</span></a> (the first letter of each word is capitalized).</li>
  <li>When sharing a link, provide a brief description of where the link directs to</li>
  <li>Use captions in uploaded videos</li>
  <li>Use as few emojis in usernames or screen names as possible (preferably none).</li>
  <li>Please don't scatter emojis between words in an alternating pattern. Ex: word followed by clapping hands emoji, repeated indefinitely. Screen readers do not handle them well.</li>
</ul>

<p>(These best practices were inspired by blackqueer.life. Thanks!)</p>

<h2>Recommendation: Image Descriptions</h2>

<p>If you have the energy for it, try to write image descriptions of the pictures you post. This can be done by clicking on the image in the Compose Box (on the Mastodon web app it's the Edit button, on Tusky it's a round A with a checkbox).</p>

<p>Image descriptions can be a few words (“Books on a shelf.”) or several sentences (“Four books on a shelf. From left to right: […]”). The text should convey what the image mean. If it’s a picture you took, explain what drew your eye; if it’s a graph, explain its behavior and key numbers. You don't have to talk about all the details; just explain what matters to you!</p>

<p>If the image is a long text, you can try to use Mastodon's text recognition if you use the web app. Otherwise, you can mention <a href=""https://fedi.lynnesbian.space/@OCRbot"">@OCRbot</a> and it will reply with its text recognition. Be mindful that OCR doesn’t always work, and it’s best to copy and edit the output of the bot rather than letting disabled users try to decipher what the text says.</p>

<p>If you don’t have the energy to write an image description, you can write so in the CW, use the :helpDescribe:​ emoji to invite people to add one, or tag the <a href=""https://a.gup.pe/u/imagecaptionspls"">@imagecaptionpls</a> group which will notify everyone who follows the group that there’s someone who needs an image description.</p>

<p>You can also follow the <a href=""https://botsin.space/@PleaseCaption"">@PleaseCaption@botsin.space</a> bot, which will send a message each time you forget an image description.</p>

<p>If you see an image without description, you can reply to the post, remove the mention of the OP, and write the image description.</p>

<p>Image descriptions or the helpDescribe emoji / #Alt4Me hashtag are mandatory for public posts (shown on public timelines).</p>

<h2 id=""terms"">Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>You can choose the privacy level of each of your toots (direct message, followers-only, public). We do not process or sell your data in any way. However, every toot, even sent in private, can be seen by the moderating team if there is a report against it. This means that toots are not encrypted and could be accessed by a third party in case of malicious attacks or legal actions. Therefore, if you wish to discuss sensitive topics, we recommend you use another medium.</p>

<p><a href=""https://joinmastodon.org/"">Mastodon</a> is a distributed social media platform, similar to Twitter. There are hundreds of different Mastodon sites in the Fediverse, and you can make an account on any of them and then follow and interact with users across all the different instances. It has easy apps for your phone too! <a href=""https://github.com/joyeusenoelle/GuideToMastodon/"" target=""_blank"">This is a great guide to Mastodon</a> that goes over what it is and will answer many questions you might have.</p>

<p>For using this server, the main things I would advise (which are all in that guide) are:</p>

<ul>
<li>This is a small server, but you don't need more people to join this server to have fun. Think of this like your email host. It doesn't matter if all your friends are here, because you can follow each other anyway and send Toots to each other. Just pick the server you like, post up there, and follow people from other servers.</li>
<li><a href=""https://pruvisto.org/debirdify"">Find your friends from Twitter and follow them</a></li>
<li>Find people and Mastodon instances you like, and follow them. Their posts will appear in your feeds, and posts from their Mastodon instance will appear on your Federated feed.</li>
<li>Tell your friends to follow you on Mastodon. Give them our profile URL, or your username of [username]@leftist.network</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=""about-us"">About Us</h2>

<p><strong>leftist.network</strong> is a Mastodon server specifically geared towards those with Leftist politics -- though your posts aren't restricted to politics! While you're welcome to follow people from this server if your politics don't fall considerably on the left side of the spectrum, we'd strongly suggest making your Mastodon account elsewhere. This is meant to be a space where Leftists feel welcome, and our Code of Conduct is stricter than other instances.</p>

<h2 id=""lack-of-donations"">Lack of Donations</h2>

<p>At this time Leftist.Network is small enough that hosting costs are very little, and moderation is quite easy. Currently the admin considers running this part of his donation <em>to</em> the Mastodon community, and if anything would like to support <em>other</em> servers. If there is someday a need for financial support, that will be communicated long before it is truly necessary.
</p>

<h2 id=""lack-of-privacy"">Lack of Privacy</h2>

<p>Please remember that <strong>public toots made on this instance are public!</strong> If you wish to only share your posts with friends, we recommend both:
<ol>
   <li>Setting the privacy of your toots as Followers Only when posting. You can set this as the default under Posting Privacy in the Other section of Preferences</li>
   <li>Choose <strong>Lock Account</strong> in the Profile -> Appearance section of your Preferences (which will only allow accounts to follow yours with approval.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Even then, as with all other Mastodon instances, your posts and Direct Messages are not encrypted, are still subject to subpoena (for this instance in the United States), and should not be considered secure. <a href=""#secure-communications""><strong>You're encouraged to use secure messaging</strong></a> for confidential communications, and we have <a href=""#secure-communications"">recommendations below.</a></p>

<h2 id=""code-of-conduct"">Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>The following guidelines are not a legal document, and final interpretation is up to the administration of leftist.network; they are here to provide you with an insight into our content moderation policies.</p>

<p>Given that leftist.network will be <strong>more restrictive</strong> than other Mastodon instances, we've separated out the Code of Conduct into 2 sections:
<ul>
   <li><strong>Common Code of Conduct</strong> (lifted in almost entirely from <a href=""https://mastodon.social/about/more"" target=""_blank"">mastodon.social</a>, the first mastodon instance)
   <li><strong>Extended Code of Conduct</strong>, with new requirements for leftist.network.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that <strong>both apply</strong>, and if you're not comfortable with the extended Code of Conduct, we recommend creating your account elsewhere and limiting interactions with accounts on this instance. If posts or messages break either sets of Code of Conduct, <strong>users are encouraged to report them</strong>.
<h3 id=""common-code-of-conduct"">Common Code of Conduct</h3>
<ol>
   <li>
      The following types of content will be removed from the public timeline:
      <ol type=""a"">
         <li>Excessive advertising</li>
         <li>Uncurated news bots posting from third-party news sources</li>
         <li>Untagged nudity, pornography and sexually explicit content, including artistic depictions</li>
         <li>Untagged gore and extremely graphic violence, including artistic depictions</li>
      </ol>
   </li>
   <li>
      The following types of content will be removed from the public timeline, and may result in account suspension and revocation of access to the service:
      <ol type=""a"">
         <li>Racism or advocation of racism</li>
         <li>Sexism or advocation of sexism</li>
         <li>Casteism or advocation of casteism</li>
         <li>Discrimination against gender and sexual minorities, or advocation thereof</li>
         <li>Xenophobic and/or violent nationalism</li>
      </ol>
   </li>
   <li>
      The following types of content are explicitly disallowed and will result in revocation of access to the service:
      <ol type=""a"">
         <li>Sexual depictions of children</li>
         <li>Content illegal in Germany and/or France, such as holocaust denial or Nazi symbolism</li>
         <li>Conduct promoting the ideology of National Socialism</li>
      </ol>
   </li>
   <li>
      Any conduct intended to stalk or harass other users, or to impede other users from utilizing the service, or to degrade the performance of the service, or to harass other users, or to incite other users to perform any of the aforementioned actions, is also disallowed, and subject to punishment up to and including revocation of access to the service. This includes, but is not limited to, the following behaviors:
      <ol type=""a"">
         <li>Continuing to engage in conversation with a user that has specifically has requested for said engagement with that user to cease and desist may be considered harassment, regardless of platform-specific privacy tools employed.</li>
         <li>Aggregating, posting, and/or disseminating a person's demographic, personal, or private data without express permission (informally called doxing or dropping dox) may be considered harassment.</li>
         <li>Inciting users to engage another user in continued interaction or discussion after a user has requested for said engagement with that user to cease and desist (informally called brigading or dogpiling) may be considered harassment.</li>
      </ol>
   </li>
</ol>
<p>These provisions notwithstanding, the administration of the service reserves the right to revoke any user's access permissions, at any time, for any reason, except as limited by law.</p>

<h3 id=""extended-code-of-conduct"">Extended Code of Conduct</h3>

<p><strong>Leftist.network</strong> is meant to be a space where Leftists feel welcome to discuss their politics, beliefs, and lives openly, without fear of constant criticism or argument. This service is only a vehicle for debate <strong>if the users in question have been clear in being open to it.</strong></p>

<p>The following conduct is disallowed and is grounds for removal from this platform:</p>

<ul>
   <li>As noted in Common Code of Conduct, continuing to engage in conversation or debate with a user that has specifically requested to stop discussion</li>
   <li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealioning"" target=""_blank"">Sea-Lioning</a> users, a type of harassment where one repeatedly asks someone to give evidence for all their opinions and generally insists on a bad faith debate</li>
   <li>Mansplaining diatribe responses. If you plan to respond to a post in a way which naturally begins with some form of ""Well actually"", ""To be fair"" or similar, don't.</li>
   <li>Playing <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil%27s_advocate"" target=""_blank"">Devil's Advocate</a>. If a user wishes to have an argument based on the other side not believing what they are arguing, there are plenty of other avenues for doing so. Unless a Vatican Council opens an account here and requests public dialogue regarding someone's Beatification, your Devil's Advocate arguments are unnecessary. Have debates only based on your actual viewpoint.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=""secure-communications"">Secure Communications</h2>

<p>As noted above, <strong>neither leftist.network nor any other Mastodon instance should be considered secure communications.</strong> We recommend meeting other Leftists here, and then connecting via secure platforms if you wish to have a private discussion.</p>

<h3 id=""secure-text-communications"">Text Communications</h3>

<h4 id=""secure-text-briar"">Main Recommendation: <a href=""https://briarproject.org/"" target=""_blank"">Briar</a></h4>

<p><a href=""https://briarproject.org/"">Briar</a> is a secured End to End Encrypted messaging application for Android phones. It's available on <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.briarproject.briar.android"" target=""_blank"">Google Play Store</a>, <a href=""https://briarproject.org/fdroid"" target=""_blank"">F-Droid</a>, or <a href=""https://briarproject.org/apk"" target=""_blank"">directly.</a></p>

<p>Why Briar specifically? Because it offers <strong>decentralized messaging with or without internet.</strong> We strongly recommend reading their <a href=""https://briarproject.org/how-it-works/"" target=""_blank"">How it Works page</a></p>

<ul>
   <li>If you have internet access, Briar can connect directly to other users via the TOR internet anonymizing network</li>
   <li>If you do not have internet, Briar can connect to local users via wifi or bluetooth</li>
   <li>If you have a message for someone not locally available, Briar can send the message to others in your private group, and those messages can be couriered to the other person when your friend gets into their area</li>
</ul>

<p>It works great for messaging each other currently, and will still work if you later find yourself trying to communicate with others without internet access, such as at a protest. Besides private messages, Briar supports private group messages, forums, and blog posts. Briar is essentially a better version of Firechat, the distributed messaging Hong Kong protesters used to communicate with each other. If you plan to communicate with others using Briar for a protest, it's recommended to have a copy of the apk to be able to give to others to install, such as connecting to each other's phones via USB, or passing it on a USB flash drive.</p>

<h4 id=""secure-text-signal"">Secondary Recommendation: <a href=""https://www.signal.org"" target=""_blank"">Signal</a></h4>

<p>Signal is also encrypted messaging, and a secure platform for messaging. Unlike Briar, which is only available for Android, Signal is available for iPhone and Android. The reason Briar has our main recommendation is that it works both with and without internet, while Signal requires internet. If Briar doesn't entirely fit your needs, we recommend installing both Briar and Signal, and falling back to Signal when needed.</p>

<h3 id=""secure-video"">Video/Audio Communications: <a href=""https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/"" target=""_blank"">Jitsi Meet</a></h3>

<p><a href=""https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/"" target=""_blank"">Jitsi Meet</a> is Open Source hosted videoconferencing software. On your laptop or desktop you can videoconference using only your browser with no extensions or installation. For mobile there is an easy app available for Android and iPhone</p>

<p>Note that while it is easy to have client to server encryption for Jitsi, using normal https ssl connections and the built-in encryption of WebRTC video, <strong>Jitsi calls are not End to End Encrypted</strong>. They are only as secure as the server being used for them, and how much you trust the owners of that server. While there is a <a href=""https://meet.jit.si/"" target=""_blank"">Public Jitsi Server</a> available, for confidential chats we'd recommend <a href=""https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet"" target=""_blank"">setting up your own server</a> or using the server of someone you trust. It's extremely easy to setup, either from your house or a cheap web host.</p>

<h2>Conduct, Content, and Moderation Policies</h2>

<h3>Terms of Service</h3>

<p>All users are expected to follow the site rules, and repeated or serious violations will lead to account suspension.</p>

<p>Creation of multiple accounts in order to avoid or evade moderation actions is not allowed. Violations will lead to suspension of all your accounts.</p>

<p>Regardless of your a2mi.social account status:</p>

<ul><li>Usage that may undermine users’ security and privacy expectations (like scraping, indexing, or followbots) is not permitted.</li>
<li>Usage that enables harassment, abuse, hate speech, spamming, or that enables violation of any other site rule is likewise disallowed.</li>
<li>Usage that violates or aims to subvert the server-level moderation policies is not allowed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Violations may result in suspension of your account, suspension of federation with your server, or network-level blocks, with no warning.</p>

<h3>Reporting Accounts</h3>

<p>When reporting accounts, please include a few posts that show rule-breaking behavior, when applicable. If there is any additional context that might help make a decision, please also include it in the comment.</p>

<p>We usually handle reports within 24 hours. Please note that you are not notified when a report you have made has led to a punitive action, and that not all punitive actions are externally visible. For first time offenses, we may opt to delete offending content, escalating to harsher measures on repeat offenses.</p>

<h3>Server-level Moderation</h3>

<p>To provide a pleasant space for the community, we block federation at the server level with Mastodon sites known to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Present security or privacy risks</li>
<li>Enable hate speech, violent speech, or other violent/hateful ideologies</li>
<li>Enable harassment or abuse</li>
<li>Propagate dangerous conspiracy theories</li>
<li>Tolerate/host content that's illegal in the US</li>
<li>Enable spamming</li>
</ul>

<p>These blocks are largely based on the list available at <a href=""https://joinfediverse.wiki/FediBlock"">joinfediverse.wiki/FediBlock</a>.</p>

268,637b2ec5d94dca7f11e7b130,dads.cool,False,176,"<h2 id=""code-of-conduct"">Hi Code of Conduct, I'm Dad!</h2>

<h3 id=""Dads"">Fatherhood is a spectrum, respect that.</h3>

<p>dads.cool is an instance for dads; if you apply to become a user, it’s expected that you have, had, or are expecting, at least one (human) child—sorry, but pets are not children, no matter how much we love them. Being a father does not mean identifying or being labeled as a man, nor does it mean that you were involved in the conception of the child you take care of. Foster dads, adoptive dads—anyone who cares for a child and identifies as a dad is welcome here. In that spirit, dads.cool welcomes all sexualities, gender identities, races, levels of mobility, and ages.</p>

<p>If a user posts a message that mocks, harasses, endangers, threatens, or otherwise puts at risk any other person on the basis of the criteria above, they will be banned from dads.cool. There is not an appeals process.</p>

<h3 id=""Replying"">Replying to Other Users</h3>

<p>Sharing your experiences as a dad is what we’re all here to do, but take care to distinguish between “this is what worked for me” and “this is what you should do.” Whatever the intentions behind it, unsolicited advice—especially involving a user's health and wellness—is often indistinguishable from harassment and will be treated as such. This is especially true when the health or safety of children is concerned. Please ask permission before giving advice to another user.</p>

<p>Generally, seek to understand what a user is looking for when they post their feelings. Is it encouragement, explanation, empathy? It never hurts to ask before you post your reply.</p>

<h3 id=""Reporting"">Reporting another User</h3>

<p>Please use the Report button on posts you feel put our community at risk (including those that might come from other instances, but are directed at dads.cool users); it is the easiest way for an admin to identify abuse.</p>

<h3 id=""CWs"">Content Warnings</h3>

<p>Mastodon’s robust support for content warnings (CWs) is a valuable part of the platform. Please consider using CWs for images that might be considered “not safe for work” like nudity or sexual content, for stories of loss or injury, for video in general, and for photos with eye contact.</p>

<p>We do not have formal rules around what exactly should or should not be placed under a CW, but repeated posts of sensitive content without them may result in a message from an admin. Before you ask another person to CW something that is disruptive to you, consider whether one of the myriad other options for personal content moderation—muting, blocking, unfollowing, or filtering words—would achieve the result of removing that content from your own timeline.</p>

<h4>A table of CWs in regular use around Mastodon is below:</h4>

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>CW</th>

<p><h3 id=""instance-blocks"">Instance Blocks</h3></p>

<p>dads.cool implements the open source ""BLOCKchain"" to block interactions with instances that might put our community at risk. Detailed reasons behind each ban can be found <a href=""https://github.com/dzuk-mutant/blockchain"">on the list's GitHub page.</a> dads.cool will not federate with any instance associated with the white supremacist platform Gab. dads.cool will not federate with any multi-user instance that lacks a code of conduct or has a code of conduct that does not forbid harassment. Further domain block decisions will be posted on the admin's feed as a local-only post or discussed on our members-only Discord; an invitation will be made available to new members.</p>

The instance is financially backed and sponsored by a Finnish web agency Digitoimisto Dude Oy.</p>

<p>Despite the name, the nature of this server is <strong>NOT</strong> temporary, on the contrary, it is thoroughly optimized both financial- and administration-wise and is constantly worked on to be as future-proof as possible.</p>

<p>Mementomori.social supports the development of Mastodon and the Fediverse and is pro-Threads and pro-Bluesky federation and ActivityPub integration. You should know that, if you have anti-capitalist or anti-commercial objectives with social media.</p>

<p>We have mostly international and Finnish users as the server is based in Helsinki, Finland.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>For the rules scroll down to bottom.</p>

<p>This Code contains the rules and principles for participating in the Mementomori.social community. The Code is intended to protect all members of our community from harassment and to ensure that our community is as welcoming and inclusive as possible. This is a working document and based on Mastodon.world&#39;s work (thank you guys).</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>

<ul>
<li>Support open and free social web movement, open source and the development of Mastodon, Fediverse and the ActivityPub protocol.</li>
<li>Provide a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for everyone regardless of gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, political affiliation, or other similar characteristic.</li>
<li>Create a supportive community, where people freely share their passions and are excited and positive about each other’s successes.</li>
<li>Protect our community from harassment, malicious or illegal content and from individual members whose goals are to disrupt our community and promote their own self-interest at the expense of the community.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Principles that guide us</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>We are not a free speech zone.</strong> This code of conduct lays out expected standards of conduct and behavior. You cannot say or post anything that violates these rules or principles and remain a member of our community. You must follow this CoC. If you are looking for something else, please do. It is not here.</li>
<li><strong>Bullies, trolls and disruptors are not welcome here.</strong> We will moderate accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>This is a voluntary community. You chose to be here.</strong> When you choose to join, you have implied that you agree with this Code of Conduct and will follow it. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Rules for posting</h3>

<p>The rules you need to follow if you want to be a member of our community are stated below.</p>

<h2>General guidance on posting and participating in Mementomori.social</h2>

<ul>
<li>Do not post about inflammatory, controversial subjects without a Content Warning. Ideally, you would not post about inflammatory subjects at all. However, it may be acceptable to do so in some cases, but it is never acceptable to post inflammatory content without hiding the content behind an appropriate Content Warning.</li>
<li><strong>Do not post any type of nudity without a Content Warning.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do not engage in name calling</strong>, <a href=""https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ad%20hominem"">ad hominem</a> attacks, or any other uncivil behaviour. Criticize ideas, never people.</li>
<li><strong>Do not report every post that upsets you.</strong> Please report posts that violate our rules but for others that you may find distasteful, or just don’t like, use the tools available to you. You can block the user or mute the conversation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Moderation Principles</h3>

<p>Reported content will be assessed on a balance of probabilities by the moderators. In other words, whether it is more likely than not that the content violates one or more of these rules. Moderators will suspend an account from mementomori.social when the user demonstrates that they have breached any rule several times, or if their content (including profile description) suggests that they are likely to continue to break the rules. The number of breaches leading to suspension is deliberately not defined. In egregious cases, one breach can result in suspension of the user account.</p>

<p>The moderation team takes a pragmatic approach to every report they receive - if they feel that a problematic post isn’t explicitly a breach of any of these rules but is inappropriate for Mementomori.social, the post will likely be removed. Users who repeatedly post problematic content or otherwise are seen by the moderators as a negative, disruptive presence in our community can be removed at the discretion of the moderation team, even if those posts or the user did not explicitly violate our rules.</p>

<h2>About</h2>

<p>Mementomori.social is a Mastodon instance hosted by a Finnish web developer Roni &quot;Rolle&quot; Laukkarinen with two decades of server and web experience. The instance is financially backed and sponsored by a Finnish web agency Digitoimisto Dude Oy.</p>

<p>Memento mori is an artistic or symbolic trope acting as a reminder of the inevitability of death, but it also refers to a various topics like a certain type of stoic philosophy of peace and acceptance, visual art, literature, architecture, music, culture, history and equality.</p>

<p>The server name origins from a stoic latin phrase &quot;Memento mori&quot; and is originally sparked from the thought &quot;what happens to the instance if something happens to the owner(s)&quot;. The admin of this server is a stoic-ish person who believes we never really &quot;die&quot;, nothing is permanent and at the same time everything is. We carry on. If not in person, then in someones mind, until the universe (and the Fediverse) is here no more. “Why should I fear death? If I am, then death is not. If Death is, then I am not. Why should I fear that which can only exist when I do not?&quot; ~ Epicurus</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. Life is long enough, and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all well invested. But when it is wasted in heedless luxury and spent on no good activity, we are forced at last by death&#39;s final constraint to realize that it has passed away before we knew it was passing. So it is: we are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not ill-supplied but wasteful of it… Life is long if you know how to use it.&quot; ~ Seneca</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mementomori.social contains plenty of modifications like <a href=""https://github.com/ronilaukkarinen/mastodon-bird-ui"">Mastodon Bird UI</a>, bigger link previews, show counts in comments and so forth. By being here you accept things are prone to changes.</p>

<h2>What&#39;s the catch?</h2>

<p>There is no catch. Mastodon should be free and available for everyone. The instance was born in Fall 2022 after Elon Musk purchased Twitter, but even before that Rolle had followed the development of Mastodon with a keen eye. Welcome! This instance won&#39;t probably be the most biggest in the Fediverse, but there&#39;s always room for one more user.</p>

<h2>Closing remarks of this About section</h2>

<p>General mental health and safe space are important to the admin of Mementomori.social. Please be respectful towards other people whenever you can. Glad you&#39;re here. Thank you for reading this.</p>

I social commerciali centralizzati come facebook e twitter offrono i loro
servizi &quot;gratis&quot;, ma traggono colossali profitti dalla profilazione dei

desideri e comportamenti delle persone (come dimostrato dallo scandalo
Cambridge Analytica). Puoi approfondire questo argomento guardando il

<h2 id=""come-funziona-mastodon"">Come funziona Mastodon?</h2>
Mastodon è una piattaforma software open source, libera, decentralizzata
e federata. Mastodon è un&#39;alternativa gratuita alle piattaforme social
come Facebook e Twitter.
Su Mastodon i messaggi si chiamano &quot;Toot&quot; (è il verso dell&#39;elefantino,
simbolo del social) ed in questa istanza è prevista la lunghezza massima
standard di 500 caratteri per ogni toot.
I toot possono avere quattro livelli di privacy, liberamente selezionabili
dall&#39;utente:
<ul class=""bullet"">
    <li>pubblico (pubblicato in timeline pubblica)</li>
    <li>pubblico ma non pubblicato nella timeline pubblica</li>
    <li>visibile solo ai followers</li>
    <li>messaggio privato visibile sono ai destinatari menzionati</li>
</ul>
I toot pubblici potrebbero essere indicizzati sui motori di ricerca. Un
&quot;Boost&quot; è l&#39;azione con cui si ridiffonde un toot altrui.
I messaggi privati, ovvero i toot leggibili soltanto dagli utenti
menzionati, sono conservati in chiaro nel database del sistema; quindi,
mentre la loro trasmissione avviene sul web con la protezione del
protocollo SSL, essi sono leggibili in chiaro da chi abbia accesso al
database.
La &quot;Timeline locale&quot; presenta i toot dell&#39;istanza Mastodon.uno in ordine
cronologico (non ci sono algoritmi che ti suggeriscono contenuti
particolari ed ogni toot ha la stessa probabilità di essere visto).
La &quot;Timeline federata&quot; presenta i toot provenienti da molte altre istanze,
italiane o internazionali, federate con Mastodon.uno. Non sono presenti
tutti i toot di tutte le istanze possibili, nessuna istanza federa
veramente tutte le altre.
Twitter è conosciuto come &quot;Birdsite&quot;.
Mastodon permette di formare una rete di nodi collegati tra loro (chiamati
&quot;istanze&quot;) che dialogano fra loro con il protocollo ActivityPub.
Mastodon fa parte del network del Fediverso, permettendo ai suoi utenti di
sfruttare la struttura federata per interagire anche con utenti su diverse
piattaforme aperte che supportano lo stesso protocollo, come PeerTube e
Friendica. A differenza dei social commerciali, non c&#39;è un solo server
centrale per Mastodon: ogni istanza ha proprie regole, policy di
moderazione, lingua e argomenti preferiti di discussione. E&#39; bene che gli
utenti si scelgano l&#39;istanza più affine alla propria sensibilità ed
interessi. E&#39; sempre possibile migrare il proprio profilo presso un&#39;altra
istanza senza perdere contenuti e followers.
Mentre ogni singola istanza è caratterizzata da una policy che regolamenta
in modo specifico la tipologia di contenuti ammessi, il Fediverso, in
quanto formato dall&#39;interazione fra istanze federate, è nel suo complesso
pluralista.

guida gratuita in italiano <u>mastodon.it</u>.
<h2 id=""quando-nasce-mastodon"">Quando nasce Mastodon?</h2>
Mastodon nasce nel 2016 in Germania per iniziativa del ventiquattrenne
Eugen Rochko, per ovviare ai limiti dei social network centralizzati come
Twitter ed evitare il rischio che una singola azienda monopolizzi le
comunicazioni.
L&#39;istanza italiana con un dominio dedicato Mastodon.uno nasce nel 2018 ed
entra a far parte della federazione internazionale rappresentando gli
utenti di Lingua Italiana. <span data-comment=""comment-deleted"">Mastodon.uno
è un&#39;istanza italiana autogestita ed autofinanziata in Italia, non è una
società e non fa data mining (raccolta, elaborazione e vendita di
informazioni personali), siamo presenti su Twitter e su Noblogo.</span>
<h2 id=""perche-mastodon"">Perché Mastodon?</h2>
<em>Affermare che non si è interessati al diritto alla privacy perché non
si ha nulla da nascondere è come dire che non si è interessati alla
libertà di parola perché non si ha nulla da dire</em>. (Edward Snowden)
<span data-comment=""comment-deleted"">Il web è relegato in giardini
recintati e gigantesche server farm che sono nelle mani di poche giganti
aziende tecnologiche. I nostri post finiscono nelle bacheche di Facebook
e Twitter, soggiogati dai termini di servizio che queste aziende
americane impongono. Le foto e i video finiscono su piattaforme come
Instagram, Snapchat e YouTube, atolli digitali completamente isolati
l’uno dall’altro. Tutte queste grandi aziende sono impegnate
nell&#39;estrarre valore dai nostri contenuti, nel profilarci nel modo più
preciso possibile, in modo tale da influenzare i nostri comportamenti di
acquisto, le nostre preferenze politiche, la nostra percezione della
realtà, solo in funzione della <em>loro</em> crescita economica.</span>
<span data-comment=""comment-deleted"">I social commerciali quindi offrono i
loro servizi gratuitamente ma traggono profitti dalla profilazione dei
gusti e delle preferenze degli utenti. Questo viene chiamato il
&quot;Capitalismo della sorveglianza&quot; e la sua accettazione da parte del
pubblico attraverso l&#39;argomentazione &quot;non ho nulla da nascondere&quot; è
stata ben descritta nel documentario &quot;Nothing To Hide&quot;. </span>
Nel documentario<span data-comment=""comment-deleted"">&quot;The Social Dilemma&quot;
viene ben illustrato come l&#39;utilizzo improprio e incontrollato di questi
dati porti a un aumento della dipendenza dai social, manipolazione
psicologica, formazione di una filter bubble, l&#39;alimentazione della
disinformazione.</span>
<span data-comment=""comment-deleted"">Questa enorme mole di dati può essere
messa a disposizione anche di governi (come è accaduto con lo scandalo
di Cambridge Analytica) per orientare facilmente opinioni e
comportamenti.</span>
<span data-comment=""comment-deleted"">Mastodon è una alternativa open
source e free alle piattaforme social come facebook e twitter, una
federazione di istanze aperta e decentralizzata chiamata Fediverso.</span>
<span data-comment=""comment-deleted"">Il Fediverso è la comunità delle
community, privo di pubblicità e di scopi di lucro, privo di algoritmi
di profilazione e modifica comportamentale. Tutte le istanze del
Fediverso comunicano fra di loro, senza alcun scopo di lucro e non si
appropriano dei dati della nostra vita social, non registrano e non
analizzano le nostre relazioni e le nostre comunicazioni.</span>
<span data-comment=""comment-deleted"">Gli utenti non dipendono da un
decisore unico e non sono concentrati e vincolati in una sola proprietà,
ma possono essere liberi di seguire utenti su altri server ed
eventualmente essere liberi di migrare verso altre istanze, senza per
questo perdere i propri contatti e i contenuti inseriti. </span>

<h1>Outras Informações</h1>

<h2>Como reportar uma violação do código de conduta</h2>

<p>O Mastodon possui ferramentas internas de denúncia. Qualquer post ou perfil que você acredite que esteja em violação dessas regras pode ser denunciado utilizando a ferramenta interna do Mastodon e ele será enviado aos moderadores.</p>

<p>Caso a sua denúncia seja relativa a um dos moderadores, você pode reportar a violação através de mensagem direta à um dos outros moderadores.</p>

<p>Você pode fazer uma denúncia mesmo que a sua situação não seja diretamente coberta por essas regras, caso a situação lhe cause desconforto. A moderação irá avaliar cada situação individualmente.</p>

<p>Respondemos de maneira privada à todas as denúncias que recebemos, fazendo um esforço para que a primeira resposta seja dada nas primeiras 24 horas.</p>

<h2>Entenda os níveis de privacidade</h2>

<p>No Mastodon cada status pode ser postado em quatro diferentes configurações de audiência. É importante ter isso em mente porque certas regras só se aplicam a algumas configurações e não a outras:</p>

<ul>
<li>PÚBLICA: A publicação aparece no feed dos seus seguidores, na página pública do seu perfil, na busca por hashtags, no feed local (compartilhado pelos demais membros da instância) e no feed federado (compartilhado por todas as instâncias federadas).</li>
<li>NÃO LISTADA: A publicação aparece no feed dos seus seguidores e na página pública do seu perfil. Porém, não é listada (não aparece) em buscas por hashtags, nem no feed local, nem no feed federado.</li>
<li>SOMENTE SEGUIDORES: A publicação aparece apenas no feed dos seus seguidores. Porém, não aparece na página pública do seu perfil, nem em buscas por hashtags, nem no feed local, nem no feed federado.</li>
<li>MENSAGEM DIRETA: A publicação aparece apenas no feed das pessoas marcadas por você.</li>
</ul>

<p>ATENÇÃO: Mensagens diretas não devem ser confundidas com mensagens privadas, pois o Mastodon não é uma ferramenta projetada para a troca segura de mensagens criptografadas de ponta a ponta.</p>

<p>Os moderadores da instância podem acessar todas as mensagens publicadas a qualquer momento e o farão em casos de denúncias. Leia a nossa política sobre mensagens diretas mais adiante.</p>

<h1>Sobre mensagens diretas</h1>

<p>Mensagens diretas não são mensagens privadas.
O Mastodon não é uma ferramenta projetada para a troca segura de mensagens criptografadas de ponta a ponta. Tenha em mente que os moderadores podem acessar a qualquer momento todas as mensagens publicadas na instância, inclusive as mensagens com audiência reduzida (mensagens diretas), e o farão sempre que houver alguma denúncia.</p>

<p>Os moderadores da fim.social pactuam dois compromissos com a comunidade em relação às mensagens com audiência reduzida (mensagens diretas):</p>

<p>Os moderadores da fim.social acessarão o conteúdo de mensagens diretas sempre que e exclusivamente nos casos em que algum dos usuários citados em uma mensagem direta denuncie a publicação ou seu autor.</p>

<p>Os moderadores da fim.social não acessarão o conteúdo de mensagens diretas em nenhum outro caso, sob pena desta ação ser analisada pelos demais moderadores podendo ser punidos com suspensão ou até banimento por quebra de confiança.</p>

<p>Não recomendamos que você utilize o Mastodon para transmitir informações sensíveis ou sigilosas, esse não é um espaço para isso.</p>

<p>Caso você tenha a necessidade de trocar mensagens com privacidade e segurança, recomendamos o uso de ferramentas e de protocolos abertos que tenham sido desenvolvidas com software livre e que sigam o estado da arte dos protocolos criptográficos públicos. Tais como o mensageiro instantâneo Signal ou o utilitário de criptografia OpenPGP.</p>

<p>BHRE Social is a Mastodon instance for the discussion of business, human rights and the environment. (BHRE) We welcome all humans with an interest in corporate accountability for human rights and the environment, including climate change. You are welcome whether you’re just starting out or are already an expert on these questions: students, doctoral students, early-career researchers, more established scholars, practitioners, workers, NGO/union/corporate professionals, lawyers, consultants, concerned consumers, journalists, politicians, civil servants, etc.</p>

<p>Real names and credentials are only recommended if you plan to use your account on this instance for networking purposes; they are absolutely not required.</p>

<h2 id=""encouraged-uses-of-bhre-social"">Encouraged uses of BHRE Social</h2>

<ul>
<li>Share news: publications, reports, upcoming conferences, calls for abstracts, and any news related to BHRE.</li>
<li>Ask questions, and answer questions asked. The power of our community is in sharing.</li>
<li>Network with others. Introduce yourself, ask questions about other people’s work and interests.</li>
<li>Share pictures of in-person BHRE Social encounters, and pictures related to BHRE issues (landscapes, buildings, etc.)</li>
<li>Rants are fine but see content warning policy below.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=""discouraged-uses-of-bhre-social"">Discouraged uses of BHRE Social</h2>

<p>The following will result in: a warning from a moderator or having offending posts deleted, possibly without prior notice.</p>

<ul>
<li>Inappropriate posts without content warning (CW) on the Local Timeline (see below for CW policies)</li>
<li>Posts of other people&#39;s work without proper attribution</li>
<li>Shortened links, e.g. bit.ly, t.ly, tinyurl.com, goo.gl, ift.tt, lnkd.in, is.gd or t.co (These are considered malicious because link-shorteners track users without their consent and obscure the destination address, which also prevents users from being able to decide whether they want to visit the link beforehand)</li>
<li>Advertisement or commercial content of any kind.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=""content-warnings-cws-"">Content Warnings (CWs)</h2>

<p>Please add CWs (content warnings) that are accurate and descriptive enough to enable reader consent to the following types of posts:</p>

<ul>
<li>strong language,</li>
<li>rants,</li>
<li>mentions of death or violence,</li>
<li>spoilers of popular and recent TV shows or other media,</li>
<li>ASCII art (this one is important to ensure that someone using a screen reader doesn&#39;t have to listen to an attempt to read out a bunch of obscure symbols)</li>
<li>anything else where another user might want to decide for themselves whether or when they want to interact with your post.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a setting in your preferences to open all posts with Content Warnings automatically, if you don&#39;t want to click through each one.</p>

<h2 id=""image-descriptions"">Image descriptions</h2>

<p>It is an expectation of this instance that you add accurate descriptions to all images and video that you post to aid in accessibility. (A description like &quot;image.jpg&quot; that does not aid in accessibility would not meet this expectation.)</p>

<p>If you post an image of a screenshot of text, it is an expectation of this instance that you transcribe the text in the image description.</p>

<p>It is required that if you are reposting images or media that is not your own, the source is fully attributed both in your post and in the image description.</p>

<p>Posts on the Local Timeline (ones with the &quot;Public&quot; privacy setting) will be checked to ensure that Content Warnings are applied, images are described, and other expectations are followed. Unlisted posts will not be proactively reviewed, but will still be subject to rules regarding abuse and other hate-speech.</p>

<p>NOTE: The &quot;official&quot; Mastodon app is NOT recommended for use on BHRE Social, as it does not allow for posting using the &quot;Unlisted&quot; privacy setting.</p>

<p>Use a CW if you&#39;re not sure that your post is &quot;on-topic.&quot; BHRE Social is not meant to be a current events news aggregator, and if your post seems to fall into this category, you may be asked to delete and re-draft it with a CW or as an Unlisted post. Let&#39;s try to avoid turning the Local Timeline into the same rehashing of the outrage-of-the-day that we see on Twitter!</p>

<p>Not <em>every</em> post on the Local Timeline should be CW&#39;d, but most should. Do your best to try to accommodate each other, and try to be understanding when there is a clash of expectations or needs.</p>

<h2 id=""bots-and-automated-accounts"">Bots and automated accounts</h2>

<p>Whilst the community is growing, bots and automated accounts are not allowed on this instance. As the community establishes in the coming weeks this restriction will be reviewed to allow for automated posting.</p>

<p>To be clear: cross-posting from other social media accounts that you use as an individual is perfectly okay, and a good way to manage multiple accounts whilst keeping your sanity.</p>

<h2 id=""regarding-attempts-to-abuse-these-anti-abuse-tools-and-policies"">Regarding attempts to abuse these anti-abuse tools and policies</h2>

<p>Do not attempt to weaponize our Community Standards or anti-abuse tools/policies against marginalized groups such as people of colour, women or queer people. Users of BHRE  Social are expected to have the literacy to understand that &quot;reverse discrimination&quot; is not real, and so attempts to re-centre discussions of marginalized people around the feelings of the privileged will be taken as manipulative behaviour undertaken deliberately in bad-faith. (e.g. white people should not demand that people of colour put CWs on every discussion of race; a straight person who reports a queer person for writing &quot;I hate straight people&quot; may find their own account suspended.)</p>

<p>If you encounter content that violates server rules, please report it. The server admins will review it as soon as possible. Content that violates server rules will be removed at the discretion of the server admins. Users who violate server rules will be suspended at the discretion of the server admins.</p>
<p>Please be aware that Mastodon is free and open-source software (FOSS), so anyone can start a Mastodon instance. Also, Mastodon is only one part of the larger fediverse. Our server becomes automatically federated with any other server with which our users interact. Some of those servers may contain content that is objectionable to you (and probably the majority of our users). If you encounter such servers in your Federated timeline, please report them. The admins will investigate them and, if necessary, block them. You can find a list of blocked servers at the bottom of our <a href=""https://episcodon.net/about"">About</a> page.</p>
<h2 style=""color:#6364ff;"">Server recommendations</h2>
<ol><li><b>Be kind.</b> Love your neighbor as yourself.</li>
<li><b>Complete your user profile.</b> Other users are more likely to follow you if you add your name, a bio, a header image, and an avatar image. If you prefer to remain anonymous, that’s fine.</li>
<li><b>Introduce yourself with an initial post.</b> Indicate your interests with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag"">hashtags</a>.</li>
<li><b>Add descriptive text to all images, videos, and audio files you attach to posts.</b> People who use screen readers need descriptive text to interpret content they cannot see.</li>
<li><b>Use the appropriate level of privacy for your posts.</b> Do you want a post to be visible to everyone, only to people who follow you, or to the specific people mentioned in the post?</li> 
<li><b>Make good use of content warnings.</b> Ask yourself, “Is what I’m posting likely to be a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_trigger"">trauma trigger</a> for some readers?” If the answer is yes, add a content warning to your post.</li>
<li><b>Keep in mind that text-based communication is limited.</b> The visual and auditory clues present in face-to-face communication are missing. If a post hits you the wrong way, gently ask the author for clarification.</li>
<li><b>If you have an issue with someone else’s post, try to discuss your concern with that person privately.</b> If you are unable to resolve the issue, file a report.
<li><b>Don’t use the server rules to censor users who hold different positions from your own.</b> Instead, be curious and ask open questions. However, if the user is clearly violating server rules, file a report.</li>
<li><b>Use camel case in hastags.</b> For example, type #TheEpiscopalChurch rather than #theepiscopalchurch. Camel case is easier to read and is a necessity for people who use screen readers. Be aware that Mastodon may try to lowercase your hashtag.</li></ol></p>

<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>

<ul>
<li>Follow some accounts, whether on this server, or accounts on other Mastodon sites, so that you get content into your timeline. </li>
<li>Images are limited to 10 MB, and videos are limited to 40 MB. GIFs are normally converted to a looping video to save bandwidth (the same way it&#39;s done on Tumblr and Twitter).</li>
<li><a href=""/settings/profile"">Opt-in</a> to let others find your account by checking &quot;Suggest account to others&quot; <a href=""/settings/profile"">in your profile</a>.</li>
<li><a href=""https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/posting/#cw"">Content warnings</a> are strongly encouraged for any explicit content that Rule 2 allows (e.g., genitals). Some of the content on this site gets federated to other Mastodon servers that have more restrictive rules requiring content warnings. Content warnings are not strictly enforced on this server; but if you post without one, followers here or on other servers will likely flag them for moderation. We&#39;re trying to maintain a balance between allowing free expression and federating with other servers that may be more vanilla or have varied norms.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Finding People</h2>

<p>When you have an account on this server or any Mastodon server that federates, you can follow and interact with users on other Mastodon servers, without needing to create an account on each one. Here are some places to start discovering content and people:</p>

<ul>
<li>Our <a href=""/directory"">opt-in directory</a> - choose &quot;From hypno.social only&quot;</li>
<li>Our <a href=""/public/local"">local timeline</a> - all public posts made by accounts on this server</li>

<p>
A few of us started this server looking for a small place to land together in the 'fediverse' – hopefully a safer place. We're front-end web makers who value humans over technology, and embrace diversity on an open, accessible, progressively-enhanced web.
</p>

<p>
We were not expecting so much interest! It's exciting! But we're still new to this, not set up to grow large or fast. This isn't a corporate venue, it's our <a href=""https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-07-14-13:42.html"">virtual living room</a> – and we have a small apartment.
</p>

<p>
It's hard turning people away, but we think it's important not to take on more than we can <em>care for, in our spare time</em>. So <a href=""https://about.front-end.social/registration/"">our registrations are currently paused, with a few exceptions</a>. Please bear with us – the goal is not to be exclusive, but to be sustainable in our growth.

<h2 id=""code-of-conduct"">Our code of conduct</h2>

<p>
  Front-end.social is a community built on respect and inclusivity. As a member
  of front-end.social, you agree to uphold an environment of consideration for
  all members, especially those from traditionally minoritized communities.
</p>

<p>
  If you think you can resolve a problem you’re having with someone’s behavior
  without getting admins involved, we encourage you to. Early interventions from
  someone’s friends and acquaintances are way more likely to
  <em>actually fix</em> someone’s bad behavior than letting it fester until we
  need to step in. Please feel free to report behavior to admins if you think
  it’s something you can’t deal with.
</p>

<p>
  Admins reserve the right to take whatever action deemed necessary if these
  guidelines are violated, including but not limited to: warnings, temporary
  suspension, and site bans. Any language or action that expresses, reinforces,
  upholds or sympathizes with any form of systemic social domination is
  considered oppressive and is grounds for removal at any level deemed
  appropriate by the admins. All potential violations are manually reviewed by a
  human being; we do not use any automated systems to take disciplinary action,
  although we may use automated tooling to help detect certain violations.
</p>

<h3 id=""membership-invitation-expectations"">
  Membership & Invitation Expectations
</h3>

<p>
  While we may be the first front-end focused Mastodon instance, it is not our
  goal to be the one de-facto instance. We want our community to remain a
  reasonable size to promote a healthy culture. We encourage others to build
  other similar communities!
</p>

<p>
  Front-end.social is semi-open. We are still actively working through what this
  looks like. We are working on our application process, which will hopefully
  include a more tailored application form than the default Mastodon one. Thanks
  for bearing with us.
</p>

<p>
  Please help us make this instance inviting and inclusive. If you are
  interested in front-end web development (or don’t mind hanging with those who
  do) and you support our values, you're welcome here!
</p>

<h3 id=""post-etiquette"">Recommended Post Etiquette</h3>

<p>
  Since this is a semi-open instance, we have some guidelines and
  recommendations for joining the community outlined below. Please keep in mind
  that these guidelines are designed to encourage positive and supportive
  interactions within front-end.social, <em>not</em> to police behavior.
</p>

<p>
  Community members are encouraged to share and recommend these best practices
  to their fellow community members, especially when someone joins on your
  invite.
</p>

<p>🗣 <em>Introduce yourself!</em></p>

<p>
  Once you've had some time to get the lay of the land, it's a great idea to
  write a quick #introduction (and include that hashtag so others can find it).
</p>

<p>❤️ <em>Before you promote, participate!</em></p>

<p>
  It's super cool to share the stuff you're working on, invite people to events,
  ask for help, share work opportunities/gigs, etc. But please try not to make
  these your first or only posts! Join in the conversation, say hello, make an
  introduction above, even share *other* people's stuff. All of these things
  will help you build connections and earn trust. Besides, people are way more
  likely to pay attention to (and boost/click/share) the stuff you share if they
  recognize you!
</p>

<p>
  In general, promoting stuff is good. It's how we learn what's going on, and
  help each other. If you're active in the community and sharing something you
  think others might like, you don't have to worry. Drive-by promotion doesn't
  help the community, so please try to avoid it.
</p>

<p>🚨 <em>Please consider using ""content warnings.""</em></p>

<p>
  We ask that you put the following topics behind a content warning (CW) (photos
  can be marked with the eye symbol - after uploading, before posting):
</p>

<ul>
  <li>graphic violence or gore</li>
  <li>flashing video/gifs</li>
  <li>spoilers</li>
</ul>

<p>
We encourage you to toot about your lived experience freely, without content warning. We don't support and will not tolerate the silencing of underrepresented and minoritized people sharing their truths – or pointing out issues in the industry and platform. That said, if you are posting on triggering topics, we encourage you to consider the content warning feature. 
</p>

<p>
  When in doubt, CW. Our goal is to create a space where we are not overwhelmed
  by negative posts or bombarded by the 24 hour news cycle. Twitter's algorithm encouraged doom scrolling. We don't want to replicate that here.
</p>

<p>
  CW are also often used as courtesy to help followers pre-screen sensitive or
  particularly noisy topics. Examples of this might include meta-discussion about
  Mastodon itself (commonly tagged 'fedi meta') or mental health (tag 'mh').
  This sort of use is not required on our instance, but it a norm of Mastodon
  etiquette at large.
</p>

<p>🌄 <em>Image captions</em></p>

<p>
  Please add descriptive image captions to any images you post. We have added
  custom CSS to the site to highlight where descriptions are added, and their presence or absence on images.
</p>

  You are welcome to your own opinions regarding technology, the web, code
  formatting, and the pronunciation of “gif” but we ask that if you choose to
  express these opinions, you do so in a respectful way.
</p>

<p>
  Furthermore—and perhaps even more importantly—strive to extend the benefit of
  the doubt to others as they express their opinions. Rather than assuming a
  200-character post encompasses the full extent of a complicated issue, ask
  clarifying questions before launching a rebuttal&mdash;or simply keep
  scrolling. Don’t make the admins “choose a side” because a disagreement gets
  out of hand.

309,637b30f3d94dca7f11e7ba22,comunidad.nvda.es,False,165,"<p>Mastodon es una red social libre, federada y descentralizada que, junto con otros muchos productos, forma parte del fediverso. Cada usuario elige en qué servidor registrarse, bajo qué reglas, y cómo interactúa con los demás miembros. Algunos, incluso, ejecutan sus propios servidores, y es exactamente lo que hemos hecho nosotros.
Esta instancia es administrada por los miembros de la <a href=""https://nvda.es"" target=""_blank"">Asociación Comunidad Hispanohablante de NVDA</a>, también conocida como Comunidad de NVDA en español. Nuestro objetivo principal consiste en promover la utilización del lector de pantalla libre y de código abierto NVDA entre personas ciegas de habla hispana. A raíz de los acontecimientos sucedidos en Twitter a partir de octubre de 2022, hemos decidido poner en marcha esta instancia, de propósito general, y fomentar el uso del fediverso entre nuestros usuarios.</p>

<p>Nota: si lo consideras adecuado, puedes copiar el contenido de los dos siguientes desplegables y usarlo en tu instancia, siempre que cites la fuente de procedencia.
<details>
<summary><h2>Recomendaciones para nuevos usuarios</h2></summary>
Seguramente te han dicho que Mastodon es una alternativa a Twitter, y eso te hace pensar que son muy parecidos. Si bien es cierto que tienen sus similitudes, también hay notables diferencias que no se pueden pasar por alto. Aquí te dejamos algunos consejos para empezar:
<ul>
<li>Los nombres de usuario son como en Twitter, pero sólo si mencionas a personas de tu instancia (por ejemplo, @jmdaweb). De lo contrario, hay que añadir el dominio al que pertenecen cuando quieras mencionarlos. Por ejemplo, @jmdaweb@comunidad.nvda.es.</li>
<li>El buscador está muy limitado, no esperes encontrar resultados de todo el fediverso con él. Sólo aparecerán publicaciones de usuarios que hayan consentido ser indexados. Puedes optar a que se indexen tus publicaciones en las opciones de privacidad de tu cuenta. Podrás usar el buscador con total seguridad para escribir nombres de usuario o explorar una publicación cuya URL tienes. Existen instancias que no disponen del software Elastic Search, y allí las búsquedas están mucho más restringidas.</li>
<li>Un Me gusta es un reconocimiento al usuario que ha escrito una publicación. Lo verá porque le le llegará una notificación, y el toot se guardará en tus favoritos, pero no se difundirá. Si quieres difundir una publicación, usa siempre el botón Retootear, rebloguear, Boostear, Impulsar, o como se llame en tu interfaz. No hay algoritmos que destaquen publicaciones, el algoritmo somos todos nosotros.</li>
<li>Usa los marcadores para guardar una publicación sin notificar al autor. Nadie podrá ver tus marcadores. Si el autor ha configurado la eliminación automática de sus publicaciones, desaparecerán de tus favoritos, pero no de los marcadores.</li>
<li>Existen varias líneas temporales:<ul>
<li>Inicio, donde ves la actividad de la gente a la que sigues, incluyendo las interacciones entre ellos y sus retoots. Los mensajes directos también aparecerán en Inicio.</li>
<li>Notificaciones: aquí aparecerá cualquier interacción contigo: retoots, menciones, mensajes directos, personas que te siguen o marcan como favorito uno de tus toots.</li>
<li>Local: contiene los toots públicos de los miembros de la instancia, y sólo los toots. No incluye menciones o retoots.</li>
<li>Federada: contiene los toots locales, y los toots de todos los usuarios de otras instancias seguidos por usuarios de tu instancia. La línea federada es un buen lugar en el que encontrar gente conocida, y conocer gente nueva. Procura no perderla de vista. Si la instancia se conecta a un repetidor, como es nuestro caso, la federada es una combinación de las federadas de todas las instancias unidas a ese repetidor.</li>
<li>Mensajes directos: contiene los mensajes directos agrupados en conversaciones. Recientemente ha cambiado su nomenclatura para llamarse &quot;sólo la gente a la que menciono&quot;.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hay cuatro tipos de publicaciones:<ul>
<li>Pública: llega a todas partes. Aparece en la línea local y la federada.</li>
<li>No listada: no se muestra en las líneas local y federada, pero cualquiera que abra tu perfil o te siga la encontrará porque sigue accesible al público.</li>
<li>Sólo seguidores: sólo las personas que te siguen podrán leerla. Si alguien te sigue después de que hayas publicado, también tendrá acceso a ese contenido.</li>
<li>Directa o sólo la gente que menciono: sólo la persona o personas mencionadas podrán leerla. Es muy fácil enviar mensajes directos grupales.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Los mensajes directos no van cifrados. Los administradores de las instancias involucradas en una conversación podrían leerlos si quisieran. No envíes información que consideres confidencial.</li>
<li>Explora las tendencias disponibles para encontrar personas con tus mismos intereses. Puedes seguir etiquetas si lo deseas.</li>
<li>Sigue al administrador de tu instancia, y procura respetar las reglas. Si no te convencen, siempre puedes migrar a otra instancia más adecuada para ti.</li>
<li>Los recursos no son ilimitados. Para alargar la vida de la instancia y facilitar su administración, configura un umbral de eliminación automática de publicaciones en las opciones de tu cuenta. Te lo agradeceremos infinitamente.</li>
<li>Si quieres que los demás te encuentren con facilidad, no descuides tu perfil. La casilla &quot;Sugerir esta cuenta a otros&quot; es especialmente interesante, y viene desmarcada por defecto.</li>
<li>Describe cualquier contenido multimedia que subas. No sólo imágenes, también audios y vídeos. Nunca se sabe quién podría necesitar una alternativa textual.</li>
<li>Si quieres redactar un hilo, responde a tu publicación anterior, y así sucesivamente. Procura poner el primer toot como público, y el resto como no listados.</li>
<li>Si echas de menos Twitter, existe un espejo llamado bird.makeup que te lo mostrará. Sigue a @usuario@bird.makeup, donde usuario es el nombre de usuario de Twitter deseado. Los tuits suelen llegar con retraso. La persona no se enterará de que la has seguido ni verá tus respuestas.</li>
<li>Si quieres informarte, algunos medios de comunicación están ya en el fediverso, pero otros no. Intentamos remediarlo con el <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://fedifeed.net/about"">proyecto FediFeed</a>.</li>
<li>Mastodon tiene una app oficial para móviles, pero no pienses que por ello está mejor preparada u ofrece funciones únicas. Hay aplicaciones de terceros que te pueden venir mejor, dales una oportunidad.</li>
<li>Si crees que una de tus publicaciones puede herir la sensibilidad de alguien, marca la casilla de contenido sensible y escribe un breve texto de advertencia.</li>
<li>Aunque en otras redes sociales no has pagado nada, nunca fueron gratis. Mastodon tampoco lo es. Pregunta al administrador de tu instancia si necesita dinero para financiarla y, si es así, intenta contribuir en la medida de tus posibilidades. Tristemente, dejar atrás algoritmos y publicidad tiene sus consecuencias.</li>
<li>Algunas apps ofrecen la posibilidad de citar publicaciones. Dicha función es exclusiva de esas apps, pero no de Mastodon. Procura siempre que puedas responder en vez de citar. De esa forma, todo el mundo podrá participar sin barreras.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary><h2>Recomendaciones para usuarios de lectores de pantalla</h2></summary>
Si tus ojos se encuentran fuera de servicio permanentemente, seguramente estarás usando uno o varios lectores de pantalla. Sigue estas recomendaciones para sacarle todo el partido posible a Mastodon:
<ul>
<li>Si vas a usar Mastodon desde su web, en las preferencias de tu cuenta, activa la vista avanzada. A continuación, despliega tantos hilos como quieras, y fíjalos. Para ello, abre la configuración que se encuentra bajo el encabezado de nivel 1 en cada uno.</li>
<li>Olvídate del cursor virtual o el modo exploración. Puede que tengas que emplearlo, pero en casos muy puntuales. Apóyate en el modo foco, las flechas y los diversos atajos de teclado de Mastodon. Estando en modo foco, pulsa el signo cerrar interrogación, pasa al modo exploración y pulsa la t para ir a la siguiente tabla. Allí verás todas las teclas rápidas.</li>
<li>Si tienes iPhone o Mac, instala Mona. Se trata de una aplicación muy completa y accesible con VoiceOver. Es de pago, pero merece la pena. También dispones de otras apps gratuitas que puedes probar, como la oficial de Mastodon, Tusker, IceCubes o Metatext. Este último está abandonado.</li>
<li>Si tienes Android, instala la app oficial de Mastodon, Tusky, Megalodon o Fedilab. Esta última es de pago.</li>
<li>En Windows, puedes usar TWBlue. La línea federada deberás habilitarla desde Opciones de cuenta, en la pestaña buffers.</li>
<li>En cualquier plataforma, también tienes a tu disposición el cliente web Pinafore. Actualmente está abandonado, pero su autor cree que se podrá usar con Mastodon durante una buena temporada. Se maneja de forma similar a la web, pero ofrece más información accesible. Existe una bifurcación suya, llamada Semaphore, centrada exclusivamente en la accesibilidad, y otra más reciente, Enafore.</li>
</ul>

A violation of rules on this server will result in disciplinary action. Users from other servers who violate the rules of our community may be banned from this server and likely reported to the admin of their server as well.</p>

Das Freisein von etwas erfährt seine Erfüllung erst in dem Freisein für etwas. Freisein allein um des Freiseins willen aber führt zur Anarchie.
Freiheit bedeutet biblisch: Freisein für den Dienst an Gott und am Nächsten, Freisein für den Gehorsam gegen die Gebote Gottes. Das setzt voraus: Freisein von jedem inneren und äußeren Zwang, der uns an diesem Dienst hindert. Freiheit bedeutet also nicht Auflösung aller Autorität, sondern es bedeutet: leben innerhalb der durch Gottes Wort geordneten und begrenzten Autoritäten und Bindungen.<br>
Die Frage der individuellen Freiheiten, wie Redefreiheit, Pressefreiheit, Versammlungsfreiheit etc. ist erst in diesem übergeordneten Zusammenhang zu beantworten. Es kommt darauf an, wieweit diese Freiheiten notwendig und geeignet sind, die Freiheit des Lebens nach den Geboten Gottes zu fördern und sicherzustellen. Freiheit ist eben nicht in erster Linie ein individuelles Recht, sondern eine Verantwortung, Freiheit ist nicht in erster Linie ausgerichtet am Individuum, sondern am Nächsten.</p>

<h3 id=""What is Mastodon?"">What is Mastodon?</h3>

<p>Here is a cute video that explains what Mastodon is:<br>
<iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/IPSbNdBmWKE"" title=""YouTube video player"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>
Mastodon is one implementation of the Fediverse, which is a network of 1000s of servers of a dozen or so different social media applications which all talk to each other to form a federated network. Anyone can run a server (called an instance), and all the instances in the fediverse share messages with each other. This allows users on different instances to follow and message each other. It&#39;s like how you can have an email address @gmail.com and your friend can be @riseup.net and you can still send emails to each other. The users and administrators of any instance can decide their own internal guidelines about how to behave and what to post, and which other instances they want to interact with (or block interactions with). </p></p>

<p>We chose to use a fork of <a href=""https://joinmastodon.org"">Mastodon</a> over other options because it is the most widely adopted and the most user-friendly and is supported by many mobile apps. The fork we are running is called <a href=""https://github.com/hometown-fork/hometown#hometown-a-mastodon-fork"">Hometown</a> and it gives us a few extra features over regular Mastodon.</p>

<p>On Mastodon, there are no ads, there is very little in th way of an algorithm feeding you posts, and you have greater control over your user data. There are numerous other really nice features that other social media doesn't have:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Individual privacy control for each post</li>
    <li>Content warnings</li>
    <li>Image descriptions</li>
    <li>Many controls for safety and filtering</li>
    <li>An easy place to include pronouns on your profile</li>
    <li>No ads</li>
</ul>

<p>There is plenty of documentation on Mastodon, how it works, and how to use it <a href=""https://docs.joinmastodon.org/"">here</a>. But we have some of our own documentation further down in the page under USER GUIDE</p>

<h3 id=""What is 438 PUNK HOUSE"">What is 438 PUNK HOUSE?</h3>

<p>438punk.house is our attempt to get more of our friends on Montreal using Mastodon and the Fediverse instead of corporate social media for the punk-adjacent online social connection, including for promoting and talking about shows and music. But really it will be up to the users what the instance gets used for.</p>

<p>This is our first time trying to run a server like this. So there might be some hiccups. We host and manage the server ourselves. Right now we are fronting the costs (which are very small). If the instance becomes more popular, we may ask for donations or run some benefits to help cover the server costs.</p>

<h2 id=""GUIDELINES"">GUIDELINES</h2>

<p>We are anarchists so we don't like rules, but there are guidelines to help maintain the sustainability and health of the instance. These may change as things go on. Please contact @admin@438punk.house if you have input or suggestions!</p>

<p>Please note that if you disagree with any of these guidelines in theory or practice, you are welcome to set up your own Mastodon instance with your own guidelines/rules!</p>

<h4>Don't post content that is flatly racist, sexist, transphobic, homophobic, ableist, misogynistic, or otherwise bigoted.</h4>

<p>This will defacto include any symbols, slogans, memes/jokes, or vapid talking points of the reactionary far right. Don't be an edge-lord either. </p>

<h4>Don't use your account to harass or troll other users on 438punk.house.</h4>

<h4>Don't use your account to harass or troll other users on other instances.</h4>

<p>When interacting with users out in the broader fediverse, you represent 438punk.house to some extent (it shows up at the end of your username, after all!). So avoid trolling or harassing other users, even if they are on other instances. This can lead to other instances blanket blocking (defederating) with 438punk.house which is usually bad. If you pick fights with bad people, they can also follow you back to 438punk.house and harass other users here - if you want to pick fights on Mastodon, even with bad people, consider launching those attacks from your own instance and not from here!</p>

<h4>Don't use your account to harass or troll regular people in general.</h4>

<h4>Become familiar with the privacy and account moderation settings on Mastodon and use them.</h4>

<p>Every post on Mastodon has its own individual privacy setting that you set when you make the post. You also have many ways to deal with unwanted content/users. You can filter posts by tag or keywords, mute or block users, block an entire instance, and report problems to moderators. More info <a href=""https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moderating/"">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Don't post any illegal content, or talk about illegal acts, or otherwise post anything that could cause legal trouble for the server (where your images and posts live).</h4>

<p>It's a stupid idea to do that here for your own safety, but also don't bring the heat to the punk house. Go smoke down the block.</p>

<h4>Use Content Warnings for the following types of content</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Nudity</li>
    <li>Gore</li>
    <li>Drug use/paraphernalia</li>
    <li>Text detailing a sexual act</li>
    <li>Text mentioning suicide, self-harm, abust, rape, or sexual assault</li>
    <li>Spoilers</li>
</ul>

<p>When it doubt, it's easy to include a Content Warning, so why not err on the side of caution? It's polite!</p>

<h4>Try to use Image Descriptions</h4>

<p>Mastodon allows the easy appending of image descriptions to any image being posted. This is more of a strong suggestion than a firm guideline - but consider writing an image description every time you post an image. Image descriptions are very helpful to anyone who uses a screen reader, and offer many other benefits to a lot of users. It's a bit of a polite social norm here - a lot of users will not boost your posts if you do not include an image description. And it's easy and fun once you get used to it!</p>

<h2>USER GUIDE</h2>

<p>438punk.house runs on <a href=""https://github.com/hometown-fork/hometown#hometown-a-mastodon-fork"">Hometown</a> which is a fork of <a href=""https://joinmastodon.org"">Mastodon</a>. 

<a href=""https://docs.joinmastodon.org/"">Here</a> is the official documentation for Mastodon.
<a href=""https://github.com/hometown-fork/hometown/wiki"">Here</a> is the official documentation for Hometown.</p>

<p>Consider especially consulting the following sections of the official documentation:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href=""https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moderating/"">Dealing with unwanted content</a></li>
    <li><a href=""https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/discoverability/"">Promoting yourself and others</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Because we are running a fork, we have all the features of Mastodon, plus a few extra features that Hometown gives us. If you really want to know everything, read the Mastodon docs above, and then the Hometown docs after! This user guide will be based on the specific set up we have here, and may not apply to a user on a different instance, where they may not be running Hometown, regular Mastodon, a different fork of Mastodon, or one of many other apps that make up part of the Fediverse!</p>

<h3>Mobile Apps</h3>

<p>There are a variety of ways to connect to 438punk.house and use Mastodon. You can connect using your browser (probably like you are right now). Using Mastodon through a browser is the most powerful way to use it. There are a few more options, you can configure more of your preferences, and it's a lot easier to find and follow new people. You can use the web-browser version on your mobile phone and it works quite well.</p>

<p>There are also a couple of really good mobile apps. We suggest <a href=""https://tusky.app/"">Tusky</a> or <a href=""https://fedilab.app/"">Fedilab</a> for Android, and <a href=""https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metatext/id1523996615"">Metatext</a> or <a href=""https://apps.apple.com/us/app/toot/id1229021451"">Toot!</a> (not free) for iOS. Mastodon also has 'Official' apps for <a href=""https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mastodon-for-iphone-and-ipad/id1571998974"">iOS</a> and <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.joinmastodon.android&hl=en_US&gl=US"">Android</a>. These official apps are very nice and easy if you are new to Mastodon/the Fediverse but please not they are missing certain crucial features! Consider trying them out first and then 'upgrading' to using one of the other apps once you get the hang of things. Besides the apps lists, there are actually lots of others. If you find one you like better, let us know! You can always use Mastodon in a browser on your phone if all else fails!</p>

<p>Note that whatever app you are using, how different parts of Mastodon look and work will depend on how the people who made the app implemented them. So it may not be <i>exactly</i> as it is explained in this guide, or in official documentation for Mastodon or Hometown.</p>

<p>Please note when using these apps, <b>you must have have already created an account here, at 438punk.house using your web browser</b>. When connecting an app to your account here, you need to tell the app three things, the instance you are on (<i>438punk.house</i>), your username, and your password. Many apps will default to the instance <i>mastodon.social</i> if you do not provide you own instance. This is the biggest instance run by the developers of Mastodon, and you probably don't want to be there. Logging in won't work if you don't properly indicate your instance!</p>

<h3>Timelines</h3>

<p>Mastodon has 4 different timelines, or feeds, of posts (although some mobile apps may not show you all four timelines). </p>

<p><b>Home Timeline</b><br>
<p>This is the feed of posts from people you follow. You&#39;ll see all their public posts, follower-only posts, unlisted posts, boosts, etc.</p></p>

<p><b>Local Timeline</b><br>
<p>This timeline is everything happening on 438punk.house. All the public posts by users on our instance only. </p></p>

<p><b>Federated or Global Timeline</b><br>
<p>This timeline will show a lot of random stuff. It&#39;s all the public posts that our instance &#39;knows about&#39; from tne entire fediverse. So all the public posts on 438punk.house, and from users of many other instances. What gets in here depends on the interacts the users of 438punk.house have made with other instances. People they follow, or posts they have commented on, or posts that people they follow have commented on... etc. There&#39;s no algorithm selected or sorting these posts, it&#39;s just a chronological feed of all these posts that have come to our instance through the magic of federation. It hasn&#39;t happened yet but in theory some offensive stuff could show up here from other instances. If that does happen, please flag it with a moderation report so we can block those instances if appropriate!</p></p>

<p><b>Direct Messages</b><br>
<p>This timeline will show all the posts that are set to Direct Message/People Mentioned Only</p></p>

<h3>Toots aka Posts</h3>

<p>The main thing you do on Mastodon is post. You follow people and see their posts. People follow you and see your posts. You cna boost posts. You can reply to posts. Posts used to be called Toots (as in, the sound a mastodon makes) and thenthey changed it to Post. RIP Toots.</p>

<p>Unlike on regular Mastodon, our post character limit is currently 1312 characters.</p>

<p>There are different options available when making a post.</p>

<h4>Attachments</h4>

<p>You can attach images, photos, or videos to your posts. Videos have to be pretty short.  </p>

<p>Once an image is done uploading, you will see a preview of your image. If you click 'Edit' in the corner you can add an image description.</p>

<h4>Content Warning</h4>

<p>You have the option of adding a content warning to your post by clicking the CW. The body of your post will be hidden until a user clicks 'Show More'. Whatever you write as the content warning will appear above the 'Show More' button. Please use content warnings for any of the types of content mentioned in the guidelines. But you can also use them other things you have deemed appropriate for content warnings, but also as a way to hide some content from the user, for example for long posts, or for a joke, or to simply indicate the topic of your post. </p>

<h4>Emojis</h4>

<p>Mastodon has a built in emoji picker, and you will find many custom emojis that we have added ourselves. If you use these custom emojis they will be visible to anyone seeing your post, even users outside 438punk.house. If you want to see a specific emoji added, either one you've seen users on other instances using, or one you want us to make custom, just message @admin@438punk.house with your request!</p>

<h4>Post Privacy Setting</h4>

<p>Clicking the globe lets you bring up the post privacy setting. These settings determine who can see your post.</p>

<p><b>Public:</b> This post will appear in the Public and Local timelines, as well as the Home timelines of everyone who follows you. It will also be visible on your profile and every user on the fediverse, or anyone browsing to your profile on the internet can potentially see this post there.</p>

<p><b>Unlisted:</b> This post will <b>not</b> appear on the Public or Local timelines, but it will be visible in the Home timelines of everyone who follows you. It will also be visible on your profile and every user on the fediverse, or anyone browsing to your profile on the internet can potentially see this post there. This is useful for posting in a thread, where you don't want to clutter up public timelines with every post in the thread.</p>

<p><b>Followers Only:</b> This post will only be visible to your followers, in their Home timelines or if they are looking at your profile. Not that if you have not locked your account, anyone could follow you without your approval and thus see these posts.</p>

<p><b>Mentioned People Only:</b> aka Direct Messages. Only the users mentioned by @ in the post will be able to see it. This is the closest Mastodon has to direct or private messages, but rather than thinking of it like a DM, think of as what it literally is: a post that only the people mentioned can see. These posts are not encrypted, if you need to make sneaky encrypted messages, use a messaging platform dedicated to that purpose!</p>

<h4>Local Only Posting</h4>
 

<p>Because we are running Hometown, we have an additional Post Privacy Setting which is the posts ""Federation"" status. This isn't in the post privacy picker explained above, but is selected with the little chain icon.</p>

<p>Federated (the chain is unbroken) means that your post will federate to other instances all across the fediverse, while also respecting whatever Post Privacy Settings you've selected.</p>

<p>Local Only (the chain is broken) means that your post will only be visible to users on this instance, while also respecting whatever Post Privacy Settings you've selected.</p>

<p>Mobile apps do not currently support this little chain picker, but if you are posting from an app you can use the special :local_only: emoji (the little punkhouse with 438 written on it) to make a post Local Only!</p>

<h3>Tips for new users!</h3>

<p>Here are some tips for new users of 438punk.house to optimize your landing here!</p>

<p>If you are coming from one of the mainstream social media networks like Instagram, Facebook or Twitter, there is definitely some culture shock.</p> 

<p>First of all, a pep talk: give Mastodon an honest effort. Regular social media wasn't easy to get used to the first time you used it, but over many years it has trained your brain. Mastodon is different and it will feel very different at first. If you don't give it an honest effort, you won't get anything out of it either.</p>

<p>One thing that is important when you create a new account is to fill in some basic info in your profile. Remember this profile is public, so act accordingly. You need to include some info about yourself (pronouns are a good idea) and what you are interested in if you want to meet some strangers (no one follows-back an empty profile with 0 posts). You need to include some kind of info if you want your friends to find you and know who it is.</p>

<p>A popular thing to do here when you are feeling comfortable is to make an #introduction post (using that hashtag). Check out that hashtag in the search bar for some ideas. You can pin this post to your profile so people can always see it, and it's something other users can boost for you so that people who might be interested in following you can find you!</p>

<p>When you first create an account, there is a good chance you will have trouble finding any content on your timeline at all. It will be shockingly empty. Mastodon has no real recommendation algorithm. Mastodon will not do much work for you to find content or users to follow. It can be a bit of a shock to have to do all that work yourself, but remember that the plus-side is there is no algorithm analyzing all your content and deciding who/what to recommend to you. You are in full control of who you follow and what posts you see in your home timeline.</p>

<p>A good way to find people to follow on 438punk.house is to find a few friends (hopefully you know some who brought you here). Look at who they follow and who follows them, look for your other friends! Another good place to look is the Local timeline. This will show you all posts from other people on 438punk.house - have a look and start following!</p>

<p>Being on here you are also not just on 438punk.house. We are part of the greater fediverse. There are many other instances like ours full of anarchists, queers, weirdos, people who post cat pictures, etc. You can see a lot of this on the Global Timeline. Exploring this world is a lot easier on a browser logged into your account. For example, the <a=""https://438punk.house/web/directory"">profile directory</a> lets you see users who have opted to be listed either on our instance, or in the known fediverse (on all instances that 438punk.house knows about). There are lots of interesting people there (especially anarchists, queers, and nerds).</p>

<p>The last thing is to use it! Post and interact. Everyone here is also new. Any social interactions (liking, replying, boosting) go a long way to building the <i>social</i> network. So get tootin'!</p>

<h3>Safety</h3>

<p>The fediverse is a big place. Right now 438punk.house is pretty young and small, so we are not federated with that many other instances, and instances we are federated with are for the most part pretty cool places. As the instances grows, there will be more and more federation with other instances. It's a big world out there, and anyone can run a Mastodon instance. There are corners of the fediverse that are far-right, or trolls, or spam-bots, or lolita porn. We can (and will) blanket block any instances that cater to users and content like that, and we have already preemptively blocked a long list of known bad-instances. But it is worth being aware that that stuff can pop up in the Global timeline. It's very helpful if you <a href=""https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moderating/#report"">report</a> that kind of stuff using the built in Moderation tools so that we can take appropriate action.</p>

<p><p>On Mastodon you have much more control over your data, but you should also be aware of what the limits are for your own safety, security, and privacy. Your profile and any public posts are visible by anyone. All of your posts and content is stored on our server in an unencrypted way. The server keeps all kinds of logs. Direct messages are not end-to-end encrypted and should not be used for anything that requires security, or extreme privacy. Use Signal if you need that. </p>

330,637b31a7d94dca7f11e7bce3,social.ridetrans.it,False,276,"<h2>Values</h2>

<p>
Mastodon Transit Authority builds community and solidarity. We welcome those interested in building thriving communities online and in real-life throughout the Puget Sound Region. We are organizers, nerdy about transit, renters, union members, tech workers, musicians, neighbors, climate activists, mutual aid participants; we are passionate about mobility justice, a right to housing, and cross-race / cross-class / cross-generational / intersectional communities. We endeavor to welcome anyone making a long- or short-term stay here, and make this instance your home.
</p>

<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>
We want people to be curious. To ask questions rather than start with accusations. We also want people to recognize power dynamics and lived experience in terms of their expectations in engaging in online spaces, as they would in face-to-face spaces. If you don’t already practice progressive stack in communities you are in, please take some time to learn what that means and how to implement it. It goes a long way to reducing harm when you’re just starting to build community in person, and online.
</p>

<p>
We will take swift and clear steps to reduce harmful behaviors. We know harm will happen and we want to make sure you can get help when it does. Moderators on this server will move quickly and seek out additional supports to remove and deter accounts that:
</p>

<p>
Espouse, or sealion ideals destructive to other people’s well-being, including but not limited to:
<ul>
<li>Violence, racism, classism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, anti-semitism, fascism, ecofascism, ethno-nationalism, settler colonialism, religious extremism, neurotype supremacy</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Carry out online behaviors that harm, or emotionally exhaust other people:
<ul>
<li>harassment, brigading (including posts that may encourage others to harass), sealioning, doxxing (weaponization of private information disclosure, such as disclosing or publicizing addresses, email, phone numbers, medical history, private identifying information, etc without consent), spamming, slander, spreading misinformation/disinformation, privacy and consent violations (taking screenshots of “locked” / private-to-follower posts and sharing them publicly without the author’s consent)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Denial of service, proper server operation, and other members’ content readability, including:
<ul>
<li>Running automation or bots in a way that overloads the server, or is unpleasantly noisy for other users</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>This server is hosted in Washington state, United States and content must not violate local laws.</p>

<p>
99% of the time, these rules will not be needed because the people here and in the broader community will be awesome. There's always the chance they aren't, so we have rules. Finally, if you run into a problem, reach out to an admin! Someone can probably fix what ails the server or tell you what's going on.
</p>

<h2>Technical Safety and Privacy</h2>

<p>
Because of how Mastodon works, no stored communications here are encrypted. Even things that appear private to you, like direct messages or restricted account posts, are not private relative to the server administrators. Server admins are <b>not allowed</b>, by rule of the server owner, to read this content; however this is enforced only by rule. The admins will treat your data with respect and privacy but if you want to make certain no one is able to see your communications with another person, consider other alternatives such as Signal.
</p>

<p>
While the instance is backed up regularly, please keep a copy of your own data in case the worst happens.
</p>

<h2>Moderators and Advisors</h2>

<p>This instance has six volunteer administrators and moderators who tend to the server, the software, and keeping posts flowing that are consistent with our rules and values. These folks are, in order by user name: @analogist, @Andres4NY (an admin for the underlying server host and not the instance), @danielhep, @kona, @oowm, @rachael. We will do our best to keep an eye on things, particularly abuse reports. There might be a delay in replying if something major happens or if one or all of us are away.</p>

<p>If this list of people changes, we will make an announcement post to let the community know. If you report a post or user, all of us receive it. Any admin can take action on their own, particularly in urgent situations, but we discuss major actions beforehand.</p>

<p>If you have questions for or want to run something past someone who isn't an admin, you can reach out to Laura Loe of Share the Cities Organizing Collective, our IRL organizing home, at info@sharethecities.org</p>

<p>This is a social community inspired by the Wheel of Time. Talk about anything, connect with people and interests across the open social web, and swear your body and soul to the Great Lord of the Dark.</p>

<h3>Open social web, what does that mean?</h3>

<p>Mastodon is one of a few platforms that support the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse"">fediverse</a>, the concept of inter-connected social media applications and servers. So while we may choose to find a home on a relatively small fandom-themed server, we can still engage with people and posts from the larger servers. </p>

<h4>How do I find people?</h4>

<p>Once you have an account, you will be able to see activity that takes place here on this server using the <a href=""https://darkfriend.social/public/local"">Local timeline</a>. You can find and engage with anybody local that way.</p>

<p>There is also the <a href=""https://darkfriend.social/public"">Federated timeline</a>, which shows posts from people on other servers. As we engage with people from other servers, those peoples&#39; content will also start surfacing in our Federated timeline and in Search. If you see something in the Federated timeline, you can also engage with it there the same way as you would if it were local.</p>

<p>If you really want to branch out, you can often view the public timelines of some of the larger servers. This allows you to explore the discussions taking place there, and potentially find new and interesting people to follow and engage with. They will just give you a URL for you to enter into search <b>here</b> so that you can engage with the content from your home server.</p>

<p>There are also browser plugins and mobile apps which make it easier to engage with content from other servers. <a href=""https://fo.llow.social/roam"">Roam with Mastodon</a> is a browser extension we recommend for this purpose. <a href=""https://joinmastodon.org/servers"">Find other servers here</a></p>

<p>Finally, we have put together <a href=""https://followlists.online/list/1677a96a-47b1-9227-2264-39782029c33d"">Tooters of Time a follow list</a> that you can download and import as a Follow List in your Preferences.</p>

<h3>Always feel free to ask</h3>

<p>Testing new technologies and new platforms can be a lot of fun. It can also be frustrating and confusing at times. Please always feel free to ask questions if you&#39;re confused about something or don&#39;t know how to do something that you think you should be able to do. For those new to Mastodon, I put together <a href=""https://darkfriend.social/web/@hybridhavoc/109249172473651366"">a short thread demonstrating some of what Mastodon posts look like and can do</a>. This is not a comprehensive tutorial, and questions are always welcome.</p>

<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<h3>Moderation Team</h3>

<p>Our moderation team members are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://darkfriend.social/@hybridhavoc"">@hybridhavoc</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you would like to volunteer to join the moderation team, you may submit a <a href=""https://www.hybridhavoc.com/category/mastodon"">moderation volunteer form</a>. We may not always be looking to expand the moderation team.</p>

<h3>Reporting</h3>

<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the moderators. They&#39;ll respond as promptly as they can. Utilize the report function or email <a href=""mailto:abuse@darkfriend.social"">abuse@darkfriend.social</a>.</p>

<p>We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.</p>

<h3>Consequences</h3>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the moderators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from this community and identifying the participant publicly as someone about whom we&#39;ve received complaints.</p>

<h3>Harassment</h3>

<p>Harassment includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion</li>
<li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.</li>
<li>Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names</li>
<li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where they’re not appropriate</li>
<li>Simulated physical contact (e.g. textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop.</li>
<li>Threats of violence</li>
<li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm</li>
<li>Deliberate intimidation</li>
<li>Sustained disruption of discussion</li>
<li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
<li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease</li>
<li>Publication of non-harassing private communication</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advertisements and Promotions</h3>

<p>Advertisements are considered to be any promotion of products or services for sale, either for money or other form of barter, that are not directly related to the primary topic of this community (The Wheel of Time) or to an ongoing discussion.</p>

<p>Exceptions include merchandise products or other services that:</p>

<ul>
<li>are officially licensed Wheel of Time properties</li>
<li>are from or related to Wheel of Time fan creators</li>
<li>otherwise are freely available to all</li>
</ul>

<p>Rules against advertising pertain to local accounts only. If you encounter unwanted advertising in your own feed or in the federated feed, please unfollow and/or block the account as needed.</p>

<h3>Moderation Guide</h3>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/joyeusenoelle"">joyeusenoelle on Github</a> was kind enough to put together a <a href=""https://github.com/joyeusenoelle/GuideToMastodon/blob/main/Moderation.md"">Guide to Mastodon Moderation</a> which outlines the tools available to Mastodon moderators. This is good reading for anybody that is or wants to be a moderator of a Mastodon community.</p>

<ul>
<li>Local accounts that violate Rule 1 will be Suspended.</li>
<li>Repeat offenders of Rules 2 - 5 may have their posts force-marked sensitive, their accounts Limited, and/or Suspended.</li>
<li>Local accounts that violate Rules 6 or 7 may have their accounts Limited and/or Suspended.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Federation</h3>

<p>We utilize <a href=""https://codeberg.org/oliphant/blocklists/src/branch/main"">the tier 0 server blocklist</a> from Oliphant and the Fedi Council. In addition, we subscribe to the #FediBlock hashtag and investigate reported servers. If evidence of content that would violate our rules is readily available either on the server&#39;s public timeline, on the server admin&#39;s personal timeline, or there are additional details that we feel warrant action, the server is moderated accordingly.</p>

<ul>
<li>Servers that host a number repeat offenders of Rule 2 may be Limited.</li>
<li>Servers that host a number of repeat offenders of Rule 3 may be Suspended.</li>
<li>Servers that host a number of repeat offenders of Rule 4 may be Limited and/or have their media files rejected.</li>
<li>Servers that host a number of repeat offenders of Rule 5 may be Limited and/or Suspended.</li>
<li>Servers that are the source of spam waves may be Limited. Spam is determined at the discretion of the moderation team.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Moderated server obfuscation</h3>

<p>In the list(s) of moderated servers, we choose to obfuscate server names when their names themselves are deemed hateful or objectionable. If you would like to know the full server name for any of the obfuscated servers below, please contact an admin or moderator.</p>

<p>Note: &quot;One Wilshire&quot; in this document refers to the Friend Camp Mastodon instance at https://onewilshire.la. &quot;The administrators&quot; refers to the administrators on this organization: currently @hunterowens@onewilshire.la.</p>

<p>OneWilshire is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.</p>

<p>This code of conduct applies to all OneWilshire spaces, including public channels, private channels and direct messages, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the administrators.
Types of Harassment</p>

<pre><code>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, immigration status, religion, or other identity marker. This includes anti-Indigenous/Nativeness and anti-Blackness.
Unwelcome comments regarding a person&#39;s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
Deliberate misgendering or use of &quot;dead&quot; or rejected names
Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they&#39;re not appropriate
Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like &quot;hug&quot; or &quot;backrub&quot;) without consent or after a request to stop.

Deliberate &quot;outing&quot; of any aspect of a person&#39;s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse
Publication of non-harassing private communication
Jokes that resemble the above, such as &quot;hipster racism&quot;, still count as harassment even if meant satirically or ironically.
Microaggressions, which take the form of everyday jokes, put downs, and insults that spread humiliating feelings to people of marginalized groups
</code></pre>

<p>The administrators will not act on complaints regarding:</p>

<pre><code>&quot;Reverse&quot;-isms, including &quot;reverse racism,&quot; &quot;reverse sexism,&quot; and &quot;cisphobia&quot;
Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as &quot;leave me alone,&quot; &quot;go away,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m not discussing this with you.&quot;
Communicating in a &quot;tone&quot; you don&#39;t find congenial
Criticism of racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions
</code></pre>

<p>Reporting</p>

<p>If you are being harassed by a member of Friend Camp, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an administrator (listed at the top of this document) directly or file a report using the Mastodon reporting system (click the &quot;...&quot; on a post and then use the reporting feature).</p>

<p>The admins reserve the right to exclude people from OneWilshire based on their past behavior, including behavior outside OneWilshire spaces and behavior towards people who are not in OneWilshire. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.
Consequences</p>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all OneWilshire spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other OneWilshire members or the general public.
Updates</p>

<p>The administrators reserve the right to update the Code of Conduct at any time at their discretion. Updates to the CoC will be communicated to users via email and posts from admin accounts. If you have any concerns about or suggestions for the CoC, please contact an administrator via DM.

<p>This is a Fediverse/Mastodon instance for climate justice activism groups and other groups who feel they belong to the climatejustice movement and follow our rules and principles as described below.</p>

<h3><font size=""6.5"">WHO WE ARE</font></h3>

<p>&quot;We&quot; is currently basically just Paula (@PaulaToThePeople@climatejustice.social), who owns the server.<br>
It is hosted locally in Vienna, Austria via the Fediverse Foundation.
The server is NOT officially part of the Fediverse Foundation though.<br>
Paula will try and found a new club to have a legal structure responsible for this server. If you want to join, holler!</p>

<h3><font size=""6.5"">DONATIONS</font></h3>

<p>The usage of the server is free and will always remain free, unless something completely unforeseen happens (it won&#39;t!).<br>
But the server costs money, which Paula pays out of her own pocket.

<h3><font size=""6.5"">PRINCIPLES</font></h3>

<h3><font size=""4"">We stand for climate justice, which includes justice for all marginalized people as well as other living beings and we stand against discrimination and exploitation.</font></h3>

<p>We are allies to disabled people, queer and lgbtqia* people, BIPoC, women, poor people, kids and future generations as well as other vulnerable groups including animals, plants and all living beings. We might be critical to religion in general, but stand up against antisemitism, islamomisia and other forms of discrimination due to religious background.
We acknowledge our own privileges and work on our own unintentionally discriminatory behaviors. We are all part of an exploitative system and it&#39;s impossible to live within that system without harming anyone. We are aware of that and try to work against it, but we are not all fossil free and vegan and that&#39;s okay. We don&#39;t exclusively post about climate justice, but at least some of our posts should be about climate justice.</p>

<h3><font size=""4"">We consider ourselves on the left side of the political spectrum and stand up against right wing ideologies.</font></h3>

<p>We have different political views, but are all on the left side or at least are left-open, but right-closed centrists. We stand together against capitalism and fascism and even if we disagree on important issues we don&#39;t loose sight of our common goals.</p>

<h3><font size=""4"">We believe the Fediverse should be a place for respectful discourse and we stand against harassment, trolling and spam.</font></h3>

<p>Everybody&#39;s boundaries are to be respected.</p>

<h3><font size=""4"">We stand up for peace and against violence, oppression and authoritarianism.</font></h3>

<p>We are pacifists, but acknowledge that when attacked, people have the right to defend themselves following international law.
We may be critical of states in general, but we never deny any country their statehood.
We condemn violence against innocent people and always show solidarity with victims of violence. We don&#39;t promote violence in protest, but peaceful sabotage against oppressors is not violence.</p>

<h3><font size=""4"">We stand behind the science and against fake-news & propaganda.</font></h3>

<p>We are not all scientists ourselves and experts in every field we post about, but we try not to spread any false information. If possible we provide reliable sources. We don&#39;t spread unverified rumors.</p>

<h3><font size=""6.5"">RULES</font></h3>

<ul>
<li>follow Austrian and EU law</li>
<li>don&#39;t post pornography</li>
</ul>

<h3><font size=""6.5"">GUIDELINES</font></h3>

<p>Try to always:</p>

<ul>
<li>provide media descriptions</li>
<li>use CamelCase in hashtags</li>
<li>not overdo it with emojis</li>
<li>use content warnings when appropriate</li>
<li>hide sensitive media</li>
<li>avoid links to privacy violating sites if possible</li>
</ul>

<h3><font size=""6.5"">DISCLAIMER</font></h3>

<p>Principles, rules and guidelines may change at any time and sanctions may be applied according to rules that have not been written yet at that time, but of course never without justification. Appeal is always possible.</p>

<h3><font size=""6.5"">MODERATION POLICIES</font></h3>

<p>These are just examples for further clarification. Our principles, rules and guidelines above are what you have to stick to.</p>

<p>What will get you banned immediately:</p>

<ul>
<li>open discrimination</li>
<li>right wing ideologies</li>
<li>harassment, trolling, spam and porn</li>
<li>calls for violence</li>
<li>sympathy for oppression</li>
<li>pro-authoritarianism</li>
<li>spreading of anti-science stances, fake news or propaganda</li>
<li>breaking the law drastically or repeatedly</li>
</ul>

<p>When will we ask you to leave our instance:</p>

<ul>
<li>when you don&#39;t align with our principles</li>
<li>when you follow our rules, but post almost nothing related to climate justice</li>
<li>when you appear more critical of other leftists than the people on the right</li>
<li>when we recorded multiple strikes against you</li>
<li>when you show a pattern of failing to condemn violence or show unreflected solidarity with a violent, oppressive or authoritarian group of people</li>
<li>when you do things that break Austrian law, but are okay somewhere else</li>
<li>when even after multiple hints you completely disregard our guidelines</li>
</ul>

<p>What will get your post deleted and a strike recorded against you:</p>

<ul>
<li>likely unintentional discriminatory behavior or wording</li>
<li>likely unintentional behavior that doesn&#39;t respect someone else&#39;s bondaries</li>
<li>likely unintentionally posting something that could lead to violence</li>
<li>likely unintentional spreading of false or unverified information</li>
<li>when you post something that we fear might get us in trouble with the law</li>
</ul>

<p>When will we ask you to edit your post and/or consider something for the future:</p>

<ul>
<li>clearly unintentional inconsiderate or unreflective behavior or wording</li>

I have decided to boldly go where no gamer has gone before. My gift to you is a gaming-oriented Mastodon instance where you will find others with mutual interests.<br>
<h2>Important message</h2>
But in order for this instance to succeed two stars will need to align, and stay aligned.<br>
<br>
1. This instance is hosted on masto.host and I need monthly help in funding it. You are welcome to participate for free, but if you like being here please consider funding it monthly if you can. Ko-Fi link is below.<br>
<br>
2. As this instance grows, the number of people who have not read the rules will inevitably grow as well, and so will the need for moderation grow. A trustworthy moderator team will be essential. Let me know if you are interested to volunteer for the job and why.<br>
<br>
If the above-mentioned stars fail to align in the long run I pledge to you that I will give you a three months notice before shutting down the server so you will have plenty of time to relocate to a different instance.<br>

<p id=""Zielgruppe""><font size=+1><strong>An wen richtet sich diese Instanz?</strong></font size></p>
<ul>
<li>Diese Instanz bietet Podcaster*innen einen Platz für ihre Sendungen im <a href=""https://joinmastodon.org/"">Mastodon-Netzwerk</a>. Die Instanz ist ausdrücklich nicht für persönliche Accounts gedacht, sondern nur für solche, die eine einzelne Sendung repräsentieren. Momentan ist die Registrierung geschlossen.
</li>
<li>Im größten Fall entwickelt sich hier ein Verzeichnis, das einen Überblick über die Podcastwelt im Fediverse bietet. Im kleinsten ist das einfach eine weitere Instanz, auf der die Podcaster*innen, die das möchten, ihre Sendungsaccounts pflegen können.
</li>
<li>Zumindest vorerst bitte wirklich nur für Podcasts Accounts erstellen, die auch euch gehören!
</li>  
<li>Und: Die Seite ist - im Sinne des Föderalismus - vor allem für die Podcaster*innen gedacht, die aktuell den Betrieb einer eigenen Instanz NICHT leisten können. Große Institutionen und Verlage möchten wir freundlich darauf hinweisen, dass eine eigene Instanz der grundlegenden Idee des Fediverse zuträglicher wäre, als hier einen Account zu eröffnen. 
</li>
<li>Falls ihr ganz neu bei Mastodon seid und euch die Konzepte des Fediverse nicht geläufig sind, gibt es am Ende dieser Seite <a href=""#ErsteSchritte"">eine kleine Hilfestellung</a>.
</li>
</ul><br>

<p id=""FAQ""><font size=+1><strong>FAQ & Hinweise</strong></font size></p> 

<p><strong>Ich möchte hier auch einen Account, geht das?</strong><br>
Man kann die Registrierung ausfüllen und sich damit <a href=""https://podcasts.social/about"">um einen Account bewerben</a>. Das Moderations-Team schaut sich zeitnah an, ob euer Account alle Bedingungen erfüllt und ob die Instanz gerade ausreichend Ressourcen hat und entscheidet dann darüber.<br><br>Falls ihr nicht zugelassen werdet, kann das eine Vielzahl von (technischen, organisatorischen oder inhaltlichen) Gründen haben, bitte seht uns nach, dass wir keine ausführlichen Absagen schreiben. Wir verweisen vorsichtshalber auf <a href=""https://podcasts.social/terms"">Punkt 1 der Nutzungsbedingungen</a>. <em>Hinterlegt in der Bewerbung unbedingt einen Link zu eurem Podcast!</em> <br><br>Ihr könnt eurer Sache weiter helfen, in dem ihr in eurer Bewerbung kurz beschreibt, wer ihr seid und was ihr für einen Podcast macht. Falls ihr jemanden kennt, der schon einen Account auf dieser Instanz hat, kann dieser Account gerne eine DM an <a href=""https://podcasts.social/@cvd"">@cvd</a> schicken und für euch bürgen. <em>Podcasts, die nicht ausschließlich von weißen, alten Männern betrieben werden, werden bevorzugt zugelassen.</em>
</p>

<p><strong>Was genau wird von einem Account erwartet?</strong><br>Vorschrift ist nur, dass euer Account wie euer Podcast heisst. Das heisst bei der Registrierung ist der ""Benutzername"" der Name eures Podcasts. Als sinnvoll hat sich erwiesen, wenn ihr in eurer Bio nicht nur den Link zu eurer Podcast-Webseite, sondern auch den Link zu dem RSS-Feed eures Podcasts explizit hinterlegt. Für die Bio empfiehlt sich eine Kurzbeschreibung des Podcasts. Juristisch gesehen sollte euer Podcast wahrscheinlich auch ein Link zu einem Impressum enthalten. 
</p>

<p><strong>Welche Arten von Inhalten erwartet ihr?</strong><br>Einerseits wollen wir euch das nicht vorschreiben. Andererseits aber ein guter Zeitpunkt in Erinnerung zu rufen, für wen diese Instanz gedacht ist: Für Accounts, die dafür gemacht sind, dass sie von den <em>Hörer*innen</em> eures Podcasts abonniert werden.
</p>

<p><strong>Was sind eure offiziellen Kommunikationskanäle?</strong><br>
Wir empfehlen euch den beiden Accounts <a href=""https://podcasts.social/@cvd"">@cvd</a> (Inhaltliches, Organisatorisches, Moderation) und <a href=""https://podcasts.social/@engineroom"">@engineroom</a> (Infrastruktur, Bugs, Downtimes) zu folgen. Wir empfehlen auch diesen Accounts mit einem Account zu folgen, den ihr regelmäßig lest - das muss nicht unbedingt euer Podcast-Account auf dieser Plattform sein.
</p>

<p><strong>Und wie genau bekomme ich jetzt meine Folgen hier in den Account?</strong><br>Leider gibt es keine uns bekannte gute und komfortable Möglichkeit, das automatisch aus einem RSS-Feed zu befüllen. (Falls ihr eine kennt, sagt uns Bescheid!) Ein erster hilfreicher Schritt ist aber das <a href=""https://zypp.de/mastorss"">semiautomatische Tool mastorss</a> von <a href=""https://mastodon.social/@eazy@chaos.social"">eazy</a>.
</p>

<p><strong>Ich habe Folgen-Toots gesehen, die direkt einen Player enthalten, kann ich das auch haben?</strong><br>Im Prinzip ja, aber wir können da nicht weiterhelfen. Ob der Toot einen Player anzeigt oder nicht, liegt daran auf welcher Plattform ihr euren Podcast hostet. Soweit wir das erkennen können, sind die Toots, die einen Player enthalten alle mit <a href=""https://podlove.org"">Podlove</a> gehostete Podcasts und haben noch ein extra <a href=""https://sendegate.de/t/podlove-player-auf-twitter/9051/7"">Social Plugin</a>.
</p>

<p><strong>Kann ich einen bestehenden Podcast-Account von einer anderen Instanz hierher umziehen?</strong><br>Im Prinzip ja, aber das geht nicht komplett. Mastodon erlaubt es einen alten Account auf eine neue Instanz umzuleiten, die Follower*innen dahin zu verschieben und die Folgschaften mitzunehmen. Sämtliche Inhalte gehen aber verloren bzw. verbleiben auf dem alten Account. Wenn das für euch interessant ist, findet ihr <a href=""https://wiki.subversive.zone/doku.php?id=umzug_des_eigenen_accounts_auf_eine_andere_mastodon_instanz"">hier</a> eine Anleitung. In der Anleitung fehlt, wie man seine Folgschaften per .csv exportiert oder importiert. Falls ihre eine bessere Anleitung kennt, sagt uns gerne Bescheid!
</p>

<p><strong>Ich bin Podcast-Hörer*in. Was ist mit mir?</strong><br>
    Diese Instanz ist tatsächlich nicht für Hörer*innen-Accounts gedacht, sie ist für Podcast-Accounts gedacht, denen ihr folgen könnt. Die grundlegende Idee ist, dass die Podcaster*innen euch (in ihren Podcasts?) sagen, wo ihr sie findet. Falls ihr nach neuen Podcasts stöbern wollt, könnt ihr <a href=""https://podcasts.social/explore"">hier Accounts entdecken</a> oder <a href=""https://podcasts.social/public"">hier in aktuellen Posts stöbern</a>.
</p>

<p><strong>Warum nehmt ihr denn nicht Castropod oder Funkwhale?</strong><br>
    Diese Instanz ist nicht zum förderierten Podcast-Hosting gedacht. Diese Instanz ist für alle gedacht, die ihren Podcast begleitend im Fediverse repräsentieren wollen, ohne ihr bestehendes ""normales"" Podcast-Setup ändern zu müssen.

<p>&quot;Seid vorzüglich zueinander&quot; ist einfacher gesagt als getan und bedeutet für verschiedene Menschen unterschiedliche Dinge.
Die folgenden Regeln sind eine (nicht erschöpfende) Liste von Verhaltensweisen, die nach Ermessen der Instanzadministratoren zum Löschen von Toots oder zum Aussetzen von Konten auf dieser Instanz führen können.
<br><br>
Bitte meldet Verhalten, das Euch stört. Wir werden den Bericht vertraulich behandeln.

<li>Wir tolerieren keine gewalttätige nationalistische Propaganda, keine Nazi-Symbolik oder die Förderung der Ideologie des Nationalsozialismus.
</li>
<li>Wendet Euch nicht an Accounts, die deutlich gemacht haben, dass sie keinen Kontakt wollen.

<li>Wenn Ihr hier mit hoher Frequenz posten müsst, stellt bitte Eure Beiträge auf nicht gelistet ein, damit die lokale Timeline lesbar bleibt.
</li>
<li>In Diskussionen bitte höflich bleiben, beleidigt keine Leute, mit denen Ihr schreibt. Setzt Ironie, Sarkasmus oder ähnliche Sprachweisen mit Bedacht ein - sie übersetzen oft nicht gut in die geschriebene Sprache und neigen dazu, Diskussionen oder Missverständnisse zu eskalieren.

<p id=""ErsteSchritte""><font size=+1><strong>Erste Schritte</strong></font size></p> 
<ul>
<li>Mastodon lässt sich im Web-Browser sowohl auf dem Desktop als auch mobil gut nutzen. Es gibt aber auch eine Reihe guter Apps, mit denen man beispielsweise Notifications gesendet bekommt. Die bekanntesten sind hier zu finden: <a href=""https://joinmastodon.org/apps"">https://joinmastodon.org/apps</a>
</li>
<li>Die grundlegenden Konzepte sind sehr ähnlich zu Twitter. Es gibt aber ein paar markante Unterschiede, die einen zivilisierten Gemeinschaftsdialog fördern sollten. Die Besonderheiten sind hier gut dargestellt: <a href=""https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/07/cage-the-mastodon/"">https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/07/cage-the-mastodon</a>
</li>
<li>Eine weitere sehr gute Einführung darüber, was Mastodon ist und wie man am besten einstiegen kann, bietet der Artikel &quot;<a href=""https://www.riffreporter.de/de/technik/mastodon-wie-funktioniert-fediverse-altenative-zu-twitter-elon-musk"">Mastodon statt Twitter? Was Musk-Flüchtige in dem alternativen Sozialen Medium erwartet</a>&quot;.
</li>
<li>Es ist zugegebenermaßen wahrscheinlich auch so, dass sich diese Instanz nicht als ersten Schritt ins Fediverse anbietet. Die Empfehlung wäre Erfahrungen mit einem (vielleicht temporären?) persönlichen Account zu sammeln und wenn man ein Gefühl für das Fediverse hat, hier einen Account für den eigenen Podcast zu erstellen. Einen guten Leitfaden für einen Einstieg bietet der Artikel &quot;<a href=""https://netzpolitik.org/2022/alternative-plattformen-so-klappt-der-umzug-auf-mastodon/"">So klappt der Umzug auf Mastodon</a>&quot;.

<p id=""Focusgroup""><font size=+1><strong>Who is this instance for?</strong></font size></p>

<ul>
<li>This instance provides podcasters with a space for their shows on the <a href=""https://joinmastodon.org/"">Mastodon network</a>. The instance is explicitly not intended for personal accounts, only for those representing a single show. Registration is currently closed.
</li>
<li>If grown to its largest, this will become a directory that provides an overview of the podcast world in the Fediverse. At its smallest, this is simply another instance where podcasters who wish to do so can maintain their show accounts.
</li>
<li>At least for now, please only create accounts for podcasts that are yours.
</li>  
<li>In the spirit of federalism, this site is primarily intended for podcasters who CANNOT afford to run their own instance. We would like to point out to large institutions and publishers that having their own instance would be more conducive to the idea of the Fediverse. 
</li>
<li>If you are new to Mastodon and not familiar with the concepts of the Fediverse, please refer to the <a href=""#FirstSteps"">tips at the bottom of this page</a>.
</li>
</ul><br>

<p id=""FAQen""><font size=+1><strong>FAQ & Advice</strong></font size></p> 

<p><strong>How do I open an account on here?</strong><br>
You can fill in <a href=""https://podcasts.social/about"">the registration form</a> to apply for an account. The moderation team will check if you meet all requirements and if our instance has enough available resources before making a decision.<br><br>A refusal can be due to a variety of reasons, technical, organizational or content-related. Unfortunately, we cannot provide a detailed reasoning. Please also refer to <a href=""https://podcasts.social/terms"">section 1 of the Terms of Use</a>. <em>Be sure to include a link to your podcast in your application!</em><br><br>You can help our decision by briefly describing in your application who you are and what type of podcast you make. In case you know someone who already has an account on this instance, that person can send a DM to @cvd and vouch for you. <em>Podcasts that aren't run exclusively by old white men will be given priority for approval.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>What exactly is expected of an account?</strong><br>The only requirement is that your account is named like your podcast: When you register, the ""user name"" is the name of your podcast. It is useful to include in your bio: the link to your podcast website, the RSS feed and a short description of the show. You might also want to link to a legal notice providing the publisher's details.
</p>
<p><strong>What types of content do you expect?</strong><br>On the one hand, we don't want to impose anything. On the other hand, this is a good time to remember who this instance is for: show accounts wanting to interact with <em>listeners</em>.
</p>
<p><strong>What are your official communication channels?</strong><br>
We recommend you follow these two accounts: <a href=""https://podcasts.social/@cvd"">@cvd</a> (content, organization, moderation) and <a href=""https://podcasts.social/@engineroom"">@engineroom</a> (infrastructure, bugs, downtime). We recommend you follow these accounts from an account you read regularly (it doesn't have to be your podcast account on this instance).
</p>
<p><strong>So how exactly do I get my episodes into an account here?</strong><br>Unfortunately, we know of no good and convenient way to automatically populate it from an RSS feed. (If you do, let us know!) But a first helpful step is the <a href=""https://zypp.de/mastorss"">semi-automatic tool mastorss</a> provided by <a href=""https://mastodon.social/@eazy@chaos.social"">eazy</a>.
</p>
<p><strong>I've seen episode toots that include a player, can I have that too?</strong><br>Basically yes, but we can't help there. Whether a toot shows a player or not depends on the platform you host your podcast on. As far as we can tell, toots show a player when the podcast is hosted by <a href=""https://podlove.org"">Podlove</a> and uses an <a href=""https://sendegate.de/t/podlove-player-auf-twitter/9051/7"">additional social plugin</a>
</p>
<p><strong>Can I migrate an existing podcast account from another instance?</strong><br>Essentially yes, but there are some limitations. Mastodon allows you to redirect an existing account to a new instance maintaining followers and followings. However, all content will remain on the old account. If you are interested in moving, <a href=""https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/"">see here for instructions</a>.
</p>
<p><strong>I am a podcast listener. Can I get an account, too?</strong><br>
    This instance is actually NOT for <em>listener</em> accounts, but for <em>show</em> accounts that you can follow. The basic idea is that podcasters will tell you where to find them, e.g. on their podcast. If you want to browse for new podcasts, you can <a href=""https://podcasts.social/explore"">discover accounts here</a> or see what our podcasters <a href=""https://podcasts.social/public"">are posting about right now here</a>.
</p>
<p id=""CastroFunkEn""><strong>Why don't you use Castropod or Funkwhale?</strong><br>
    This instance is NOT meant for federated podcast <em>hosting</em>. This instance is meant for anyone who wants to represent their podcast in the Fediverse in an accompanying way, without having to change their existing podcast setup. 
</p>

    </li>
<li>We do not tolerate violent nationalist propaganda, Nazi symbolism, or the promotion of Nazi ideology.
    </li>
<li>Do not contact accounts that have made it clear that they do not want to be contacted. This includes (inciting and conspiring to) mass interaction or incitement against such accounts.

<li>Paid advertisement must be marked with #advertising and not be excessive or automated.
    </li>
<li>Bots may only interact with an account when prompted by that user.
    </li>
<li>If you post here with high frequency, please set your posts to unlisted to keep the local timeline readable.
    </li>
<li>Please remain polite in discussions, do not insult people you are chatting with. Use irony, sarcasm, or similar language wisely - it often doesn&#39;t translate well into written language and tends to escalate discussions or lead to misunderstandings.
    </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p id=""FirstSteps""><font size=+1><strong>First steps</strong></font size></p> 
<ul>
<li>Mastodon is easy to use in a web browser on both desktop and mobile. However, there are also a number of good apps that can be used to receive notifications, for example. Some of the most popular ones can be found <a href=""https://joinmastodon.org/apps"">here</a>.
    </li>
<li>The basic concepts of Mastodon are very similar to Twitter. However, there are a few striking differences that ought to encourage a civilized community discourse. The specifics are well laid out <a href=""https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/07/cage-the-mastodon"">here</a>.

    </li>
<li>Admittedly, this instance might not be a good first step into the Fediverse. It&#39;s recommended that you gain experience with a (perhaps temporary?) personal account, and once you have a feel for the Fediverse, create an account for your own podcast here. A good guide for getting started can be found <a href=""https://fedi.tips/mastodon-and-the-fediverse-beginners-start-here/"">on Fedi.Tips</a>.

<h2>Short introduction</h2>

<p>This instance has been made to increase the options between queer and furry servers! We&#39;re aiming to be a nice and friendly instance 🐕!</p>

<p>Everyone who feels like they fit our environment is welcome, although this is an instance for queer, furry or tech people, anyone is welcome as long as they&#39;re respectful.</p>

<p>For questions please let me know over at @Purple, or use the email address located on this about page.</p>

<h2>Staff</h2>

<p>This instance is currently managed by the following team members:</p>

Advanced Search: Supported (+ Extended search patch)<br>
Post translation: Supported    </p>

<h2>Management and Rules</h2>

<p>Our server rules are made to provide a guideline on how to behave on our instance, please check them when unsure about something. The rules may change from time to time, if noteworthy changes are in effect this will be communicated through announcements. </p>

<p>As this server is predominantly queer, we have a zero-tolerance policy for hate (especially homophobia and transphobia). If you feel like this may clash with your personal beliefs we&#39;d prefer you finding a different instance. </p>

<p>Questions about our rules are always appreciated, don&#39;t hesitate to contact an Admin if anything is unclear.</p>

<h2>Instance maintainability</h2>

<p>I (@Purple) consider it important for an instance to be flexible and maintainable. Users of our instance rely on it being available and staying available in the foreseeable future and any doubt of this may hurt trust in this instance. </p>

<p>Because of this when setting up this instance I&#39;ve made sure it&#39;s scalable, with minimal effort we can easily scale up to support thousands of users without major upgrades to how the infrastructure is set up.</p>

<h3>Our current setup looks like this:</h3>

<h4>Server hosting:</h4>

<p>We&#39;re currently hosting our instance on Hetzner&#39;s Cloud service. This allows us to easily scale up the amount of CPU cores or memory with downtime of less than a few minutes. </p>

<p>Our servers are located in Finland, Europe and currently exist out of 3 VMs for future-proofing and scalability. They have a combined 6 CPU Cores and 14GB of ram.</p>

<p>We can reasonably scale the main server up to 16 cores + 64GB ram before we should look into other options, it&#39;s unlikely we&#39;d need to make major changes to our architecture until we hit a few thousand active users or more.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a Linux System Administrator by trade with experience with scaling and optimisation, so this instance strongly benefits from my personal experience in this field :)</p>

<h4>Storage hosting:</h4>

<p>For our storage of our cache content, we use our own S3 solution hosted in The Netherlands. For user content, content we use Scaleway&#39;s S3. Using Scaleway allows us to pay only for the storage we use, with the added benefit of not having to worry about running out of space. </p>

<p>Using S3 means we can more easily move our server around if this happens to be needed, making a migration quick and painless. It also offloads the responsibility of serving image and video content away from our main server. </p>

<p>Our storage location for image and video content is The Netherlands, our storage location for backups is France as Scaleway offers additional data redundancy there. </p>

<h4>CDN hosting:</h4>

<p>Making sure our instance stays fast and responsive, we make use of Bunny.net&#39;s CDN service to serve our static image and video content. Especially users outside of Europe will benefit from this as it will provide significantly lower latency for popular cached content. </p>

<h2>Data retention</h2>

<p>Because of how federation works, your posts (even through deleted) may hang around on other servers. Although mastodon will inform those instances the post has been removed, we can&#39;t guarantee other instances successfully receive or honour this request. This rarely seems to be an issue, but it is something to keep in mind when posting anything to the internet. </p>

<p>When you remove a post the following happens on our side:</p>

<h3>Text content</h3>

<p>The post itself is removed from our database right away and is inaccessible for anyone including administrators. The only place it may stay around is our backups, which are permanently removed after 60 days. These backups are never accessed unless in a recovery scenario.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline:</strong><br>
- Inaccessible (Through timeline): Right away<br>
- Inaccessible (Through direct URL): Right away<br>
- Permanently unrecoverable: 60 days </p>

<h3>Image/Video content</h3>

<p>Although the content is removed from our storage provider right away, it may stay available through our CDN for a prolonged amount of time for users who have the exact URL to the images. We&#39;re working on a solution to immediately remove the content from our CDN, but this currently is not possible. </p>

<p>The CDN will lose the content after it has not been accessed for a bit. However because the CDN caching servers will only remove content if it deems caching other files more important (more frequently accessed etc.), it is hard to tell the exact timeframe.</p>

<p>We will purge the cache a few times a year to allow all files to be refreshed, regardless of file popularity. However unless someone has been constantly refreshing the URL every couple of hours to keep it considered &quot;HOT&quot; on the CDN the file will be gone in a day.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline:</strong><br>
- Inaccessible (Through timeline): Right away<br>
- Inaccessible (Through direct URL): Usually: 4-48 hours, but up to 120 days
- Permanently unrecoverable: Usually: 4-48 hours, but up to 120 days</p>

<h2>About this server</h2>

<p>This is a Norwegian mastodon instance and safe haven for social exchange between tech people from the University of Oslo, Norway. Despite that, this site has no affiliation nor it belongs to the University of Oslo.</p>

<p>It is also opened for other tech people and/or friends from around the world. </p>

<p>The name &quot;babb.be&quot; is because of the love for good kebabs that we share at <a href=""https://usit.uio.no"">USIT</a> (University Center for Information Technology at the <a href=""https://uio.no"">University of Oslo</a>. On our team, we call them affectionally &quot;babb&quot;. Unfortunately, <em>babb.no</em> wasn&#39;t available, so the only one was <code>.be</code>. It came to us that &quot;babbe&quot; is used pejoratively for immigrants in Sweden - which is kinda ironic, since the admin of this site has indeed and proudly, a foreign background.</p>

<h2>Mastodon Server Covenant</h2>

371,637c47d2922c9ef4aa742c35,toots.matapacos.dog,False,224,"<p>Among the Mastodon universe, I&#39;ve noticed few distinct types of instances.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There are the &quot;flagship&quot; general-interest instances.  It is the goal of these instance operators to keep political strife to a minimum (within reason) to make the instance as welcoming as possible to as many users as possible.  These tend to be fairly good about removing outright Nazis and hate speech, but politics is often treated as a potentially triggering subject (fair enough).  In short, they are run by Liberals.  They will embrace calls for solidarity, inclusion, and emancipation insofar as it doesn&#39;t undermine the established Liberal institutions.  Anything going further seems to stand on shaky ground.</p></li>
<li><p>There are the special interest instances.  Instances focused on subjects from comics to electronics to cooking to LGBTQIA+ and issues of intersectional oppression.  I assume many of the operators and members of these instances would like to, more or less, remain out of the fray and focus on these interests.  There is a reason their members chose these spaces instead of more mainstream or more explicitly political ones.  While many of them may be operated or used by comrades, they don&#39;t seem like the correct place to go and talk about Communism 24/7 unless you have a credible reputation in that community.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, there are the anti-capitalist instances.  These instances are primarily focused on politics, and they are on the correct side of the defining struggle of our epoch - however - among them there is a disappointing amount of sectarianism.  I will always assume the best of my comrades, but none of these places (at least the ones with open registration) seem like a good fit for me or many of my comrades from Hexbear.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So my goal here is to establish an anti-sectarian instance along the lines of <a href=""https://www.hexbear.net"">Hexbear</a> where Anarchists and Marxists are welcome.  A space where the focus remains eternally on our leviathan enemy, bourgeois class society, the greatest existential threat to humanity and the planet. A place where a full spectrum of anti-capitalist tactics and theoretical perspectives can be entertained in good faith.</p>

<p>
<strong>tldr.nettime</strong> is an instance for artists, researchers, and activists interested in exploring the intersections of technology, culture, and politics.
</p>

<p>
It has grown out of <a href=""https://nettime.org"">nettime-l</a>, one of the longest-running mailing lists on the net with a focus on the 'cultural politics of the internet'.
</p>

<p><a href=""https://nettime.org"">nettime.org</a></p>

<h2>Server</h2>

<p>tldr.nettime is based on <a href=""https://github.com/hometown-fork/hometown""> Hometown</a>, a fork of Mastodon. It&#39;s compatible with the wider fediverse, but it also offers two tweaks we hope will help make it particularly engaging and fostering a shared sense of place:
<ul>
<li>The character count per message is higher — 2000 chars at the moment.</li>
<li>You can choose whether your post is public or visible only on tldr&#39;s local timeline</li>
</ul>
<p>
We try to run a stable server, but this is a community effort, so we don&#39;t provide guarantees for uptime.</p>

<h2>Funding</h2>

<p>The server is run by care and free labor of everyone involved. To cover infrastructure cost, we need donations. If you value this instance and have some money to contribute, please do so.</p>

<p>The best way is to send money directly to our bank account.</p>

<p>Account holder: TLDR Association<br>

<p>You can also <a href=""https://donorbox.org/community-funding-for-nettime""> a donation form (link to donorbox.org)</a>, though processing fees are considerably higher.</p>

<h2>Guidelines</h2>

<p>
Please read the information below before signing up to and/or using tldr.nettime. If you don’t agree to the terms set out here, please do not use this server. It's that simple.</p>

<p>
<strong>We have a commitment to critical analysis, experiments, mutual care, diversity, and anti-discriminatory practices. The instance is lightly moderated, on an account basis. In other words, we will ban accounts that don't share our commitment.</strong> 
</p>

<p>The community will give itself more detailed rules if necessary. </p>

<p><p>
<strong>Language:</strong> There are no language rules on this server. English is de facto the main language, but feel free (even encouraged!) to post in other languages.
<br><br>
<strong>Content warnings:</strong> We do not require a content warning (CW). However, we ask that you be kind and considerate: include CWs if you believe your post may be distressing to others.
<br><br>
<strong>Bots:</strong> Bots are allowed. Try to make them fun.
<br><br>
<strong>Cross-posting:</strong> Cross-posting from Twitter, RSS, etc. is fine (and even encouraged if it helps you become more active here).
<br><br>
<strong>Topics:</strong> You do not need to remain permanently &quot;on topic&quot;. The point of this community is to gather like-minded people who will make posts that are interesting to each other. But that doesn&#39;t mean that everything has to be about the &#39;cultural politics of the internet&#39; (whatever that is....). This is a community to connect people, not enforce specific topics of discussion.
<br><br>
<strong>Self-promotion:</strong> There are many writers, artists, and other cultural producers on this server, and we are more than happy for you to promote your work from your personal account. We request, however, that you do so in a tasteful and not spammy manner.

<h1><font color=""858AFA"">Our Origin Story</font></h1>

<p>With the ongoing <strong><font color=""9BAEC8"">climate-catastrophes</font></strong> and the implosion of vital social media companies, our team realized that our citizens and activists <em>urgently</em> needed a replacement that was more <strong><font color=""9BAEC8"">resilient</font></strong>, <strong><font color=""9BAEC8"">trustworthy</font></strong>, and <strong><font color=""9BAEC8"">sensitive</font></strong> to our needs and cultures - <strong><em><font color=""#00A550"">Paktodon.Asia</font></em></strong>.</p>

<p>The specific needs of both activists and ordinary citizens are <em>never</em> a priority for social media platforms:</p>

<p>What we see is decided by toxic algorithms devoted to commercial interests; Our security and freedoms are overlooked; Our mental health is never even an afterthought.</p>

<p>We intend to counter these challenges by building a <strong><font color=""9BAEC8"">tolerant</font></strong>, <strong><font color=""9BAEC8"">empathetic</font></strong>, and <strong><font color=""9BAEC8"">safe</font></strong> organic <strong><font color=""9BAEC8"">community</font></strong> where agency lies with the user.</p>

<p>This <strong><font color=""858AFA"">mastodon instance</font></strong> strives to be a space where people can come together, form <strong><font color=""9BAEC8"">community</font></strong> and join advocacy, create action for the <strong><font color=""9BAEC8"">climate fight</font></strong> and social injustices facing us, learn and grow;</p>

<p>or simply <em>just be themselves!</em></p>

<h1><font color=""9baec8""><font color=""858AFA"">Why Trust</font> <font color=""00A550"">Paktodon?</font></h1>

<p><strong><font color=""#00A550"">Paktodon.Asia</font></strong> aims to bring our <strong><font color=""9BAEC8"">citizens’ voices online</font></strong>, under the premise of <strong><font color=""9BAEC8"">safety</font></strong> and <strong><font color=""9BAEC8"">trust</font></strong>.</p>

<p><font size=""3px"">How?</font>  </p>

<p>Simple,  </p>

<p>we <font color=""9BAEC8"">will</font> <strong><font color=""9BAEC8"">vet</font></strong> <strong><em><font color=""9BAEC8"">every</font></em></strong> account joining our <strong><font color=""858AFA"">instance</font></strong>, whether they remain anonymous or use their real identity.</p>

<p>We <strong><font color=""9BAEC8"">will</font></strong> <strong><em><font color=""9BAEC8"">not</font></em></strong> <strong><font color=""9BAEC8"">keep</font></strong> <em>any</em> private data, but we <strong><em><font color=""9BAEC8"">will</font></em></strong> <strong><font color=""9BAEC8"">make sure</font></strong> that <em>every</em> account is a <strong><font color=""9BAEC8"">real</font></strong> <strong><em><font color=""9BAEC8"">genuine</font></em></strong> <strong><font color=""9BAEC8"">person</font></strong> <font size=""2px"">(<em>anonymous users</em>)</font>, or <strong><em><font color=""9BAEC8"">are</font></em></strong> <strong><font color=""9BAEC8"">who they</font></strong> <strong><em><font color=""9BAEC8"">say</font></em></strong> <strong><font color=""9BAEC8"">they are</font></strong> <font size=""2px"">(<em>real identity users</em>)</font>.</p>

<p><strong><font color=""9BAEC8"">Honesty</font></strong> and <strong><font color=""9BAEC8"">trust</font></strong> immensely help improve the quality of online discourse.  </p>

<p>If you see <strong><font color=""9BAEC8"">a user from</font></strong> <strong><font color=""#00A550"">Paktodon.Asia</font></strong> you can rest easy – <em>they are a</em> <strong><em><font color=""9BAEC8"">genuine account</font></em></strong> belonging to that person.  </p>

<h1><font color=""858AFA"">Assuring Safety</font></h1>

<p><strong><font color=""#00A550"">Paktodon.Asia</font></strong> <strong><font color=""9BAEC8"">pledges</font></strong> to follow the <strong><font color=""858AFA"">Mastodon</font></strong> <em>&#39;Server Covenant&#39;</em>, in addition to our own moderation <em>&#39;Server Rules&#39;</em> <font size=""2px"">(<em>see below</em>)</font>.</p>

<p>However, <strong><font color=""9BAEC8"">safety</font></strong> is always an ongoing task: please <strong><font color=""9BAEC8"">help</font></strong> our team by <strong><font color=""9BAEC8"">reporting</font></strong> any toots <font size=""2px"">(<em>posts</em>)</font> or behaviours you feel do not belong here.  </p>

<p>Thanks to <strong><font color=""858AFA"">mastodon’s</font></strong> design, our <strong><font color=""9BAEC8"">Admins</font></strong> are able to use <em>multiple</em> tools to deal with such issues quickly, and <strong><em><font color=""9BAEC8"">will do so!</font></em></strong>  </p>

<h1>Rules</h1>

<p><em>We acknowledge that rules will never be comprehensive or cover every possible situation. Our instance rules are meant to be respected closely in cases that they do cover and to inform how we act in cases where they aren&#39;t explicit. Always try to act in the spirit of these rules.</em></p>

<p><strong>This instance is hosted in Germany. All content posted on <code>strangeobject.space</code> must abide by German laws and regulations regardless of our own rules.</strong></p>

<h2>General</h2>

<p>Members must be 18 years old or older.</p>

<p>As members of <code>strangeobject.space</code> we accept these rules and commit to creating an inclusive and respectful environment for ourselves and others.</p>

<p>We do not tolerate oppression of people on the basis of who they are. This includes but is not limited to: gender, race, ethnicity, language, body size and shape, religion or spirituality, nationality, age, disability and sexual orientation.</p>

<p>We define oppression as any language or action that expresses, reinforces, upholds or sympathizes with any form of systemic social domination.</p>

<li>spam</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bots, Automation and Organizations</h2>

<p>Accounts on <code>strangeobject.space</code> are intended for human beings. Bots are generally not allowed on this instance. Exceptions must be explicitly allowed by the admins of the instance.</p>

<p>Tools that post on behalf on humans, like cross-posters that mirror content from other social media sites, are permitted but should be used with care and only replicate content that their owner has posted themselves (e.g. no retweets). All rules still apply in full to content that is posted through such a tool.</p>

<p>Organizations and institutions should generally not have accounts on <code>strangeobject.space</code>. Exceptions are possible but rare and need to be decided on by the moderators/admins.</p>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>

<p>Visual media that is posted to the public timeline should always have a text description that conveys its content accurately to someone who cannot see the image.</p>

<p>We avoid large clusters of non-text characters (e.g. Emoji and &quot;glitchy text&quot;), and refrain from using them in usernames at all unless we have actually tested how they are pronounced by a screen-reader and that it doesn&#39;t inhibit reading the timeline.</p>

<h2>Nudity, Sex and Sex Work, Kink</h2>

<p>Discussion and depiction of sexual, erotic, kinky and sex-work related content is explicitly allowed on <code>strangeobject.space</code> <strong>as long as it&#39;s not illegal in Germany</strong>.</p>

<p>Anything that falls into these categories should be posted with a content warning (CW) and media marked as sensitive when the post appears on a public timeline.</p>

<p>Other users should only be tagged in these posts if they have consented to it.</p>

<h2>Content warnings</h2>

<p>In addition to previous mentions of content warnings (CWs), the following types of content should be posted with a CW when they appear on the public timeline:</p>

<ul>
<li>violence (depiction and graphic description)</li>
<li>self harm and suicide</li>
<li>dieting and eating disorders</li>
<li>citing/quoting content that would violate any of our rules, including screenshots of such content</li>
<li>visual media with rapid flashing/blinking</li>
</ul>

<h2>Creative Works</h2>

<p>When posting works created by others (e.g. photos, artworks, comics, music, video, etc.), include attribution for the original artist/creator. If possible link back to their original post.</p>

<p>This rule does not apply to the citing of popular media, for example a screenshot or GIF from a movie, or things like memes.</p>

<h2>Crypto</h2>

<p>We don&#39;t tolerate promotion of any cryptocurrency, NFTs, de-fi, and related projects.</p>

<h1>Violations, Conflict and Appeals</h1>

<p>We strive to own our mistakes and to learn from them. When we receive feedback on our behaviour that we disagree with, our first reaction should be to listen. Many conflicts can be resolved by trying to see them from another person&#39;s perspective.</p>

<p>When directly engaging with each other isn&#39;t possible for any involved parties, the moderators/admins of <code>strangeobject.space</code> can intervene and will act in accordance with our rules.</p>

<p><strong>Severe or repeated violations of our instance&#39;s rules can lead to <a href=""https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/moderation/#individual-moderation"">freezing, limiting and suspending</a> of a user&#39;s account.</strong></p>

<p>Moderation decisions can be appealed to either via DM to <code>@admin@strangeobject.space</code>, or if that&#39;s not possible (e.g. after suspension) via email to <a href=""mailto:mail@strangeobject.space"">mail@strangeobject.space</a>. Appealing via the personal accounts of moderators or admins on this instance is unacceptable and will result in suspension.</p>

393,638771076de0ac59d2a104a4,masto.bg,False,214,"<p>Masto BG е един от първите българоезични сървъри на децентрализираната социална мрежа Mastodon. Нашата цел е да създадем среда за българи, които искат да избягат от токсичността на корпоративните социални мрежи, най-вече Facebook.</p>

<h2>Защо трябва да се откъснем от Facebook?</h2>

<p>Доминацията на Facebook в България е безспорна. Към момента във Facebook има 4,3 милиона български потребители, което е около 65% от цялото население на страната.</p>

<p>Алгоритмите на Facebook насърчават разпространението на дезинформация, фалшиви новини и радикално съдържание, което дестабилизира нашето общество. </p>

<p>Изключително притеснителна е и тенденцията алгоритмите на Facebook да се експлоатират от руски агенти за разпространението на дезинформация, което във време на война е буквална заплаха за националната сигурност на България.</p>

<p>За жалост Meta са показали цялостно нежелание да адресират тези проблеми и вместо да ограничават разпространението на дестабилизиращо съдържание, техните алгоритми му дават тласък, докато същевременно модераторската политика заглушава автентични граждански гласове.</p>

<h2>Защо Mastodon предоставя алтернатива?</h2>

<p>Борбата с корпоративни гиганти като Meta е почти непосилна за държави като България. Произволът, който си позволяват тези големи компании, е заплаха за тъканта на обществата по света.</p>

<p>Mastodon е най-голямата децентрализирана социална мрежа, която не се притежава от нито една корпорация, а от хиляди администратори на сървъри по целия свят.</p>

<p>Разбира се, тези администратори могат да упражняват авторитарен контрол върху своите потребители. Но в Mastodon потребителят винаги има избор да се премести на друг сървър само с един клик и да запази всичките си последователи. Това значи, че сървър, който злоупотребява със своите модераторски правомощия ще бъде бързо напуснат от всичките си потребители. Никоя корпоративна социална мрежа не може да се похвали със същото.</p>

<p>От друга страна, на който и сървър да се намираш, ти си част от Fediverse, тоест всички сме на една мрежа, дори и да сме на различни сървъри. Всеки потребител може да следва потребители от всеки друг сървър и да споделя тяхното съдържание.</p>

<p>Това означава, че Mastodon ни предоставя алтернатива на централизираните социални мрежи. Тук можем да намерим баланса между свобода на словото и модерация на съдържанието.</p>

<h2>Модераторска философия</h2>

<p>Цялостният ни стремеж е да създадем общност, в която хората да могат да споделят мислите си, да водят конструктивни диалози и да си прекарват приятно, без да им бъдат насаждани постоянно гняв, страх, омраза.</p>

<p>Ако сте мили, учтиви, уравновесени и не разпространявате руска или фашистка пропаганда, няма нужда да се притеснявате от модераторската ни политика.</p>

<h2>Информация за собственост</h2>

<p>Masto BG е собственост на Блу Дот Технолоджис ЕООД, еднолично дружество, собственост на Благослав Михайлов, с ЕИК 204744767, седалище и адрес на управление град София, бул „Цариградско шосе“ №133.</p>

<p>Ако нашата общност се разрастне достатъчно, имаме пълното желание да обособим този сървър като сдружение, което членовете да издържат и да имат възможност да участват във взимането на решения, включително такива касаещи модераторската политика.</p>

<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>(For the <strong>rules</strong> scroll down below!!)</p>

<p>This Code contains the rules and principles for participating in the Musicworld.social community. It is intended to protect all members of our community from harassment and to ensure that our community is as welcoming and inclusive as possible. This is a working document, so the Musicworld.social team may amend it from time to time.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<ul>
<li>Provide a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for everyone regardless of gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, political affiliation, or other similar characteristic.</li>
<li>Create a supportive community, where people freely share their passions and are excited and positive about each other’s successes.</li>
<li>Protect our community from harassment, malicious or illegal content and from individual members whose goals are to disrupt our community and promote their own self-interest at the expense of the community.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Principles that Guide us</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>We are not a free speech zone.</strong> This CoC lays out expected standards of conduct and behavior. You cannot say or post anything that violates these rules or principles and remain a member of our community. You must follow this CoC. If you are looking for something else, please do. It is not here.</li>
<li><strong>The Moderators are not morality or thought police.</strong> Moderators are guided by this Code of Conduct. Post what you want, if what you post follows these rules, principles and the goals outlined above. Not every member of the community will appreciate controversial or explicit posts so use Content Warnings very liberally. We use Content Warnings so community members themselves can decide whether they want to see or engage with a post that may be controversial or explicit.</li>
<li><strong>Bullies, trolls and disruptors</strong> are not welcome in Musicworld.social. We will moderate accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>This is a voluntary community. You chose to be here.</strong> When you choose to join, you have implied that you agree with this Code of Conduct and will follow it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rules for posting</h2>

<p>The rules you need to follow if you want to be a member of our community are stated below.</p>

<h2>General guidance on posting and participating in Mastodon.world</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Do not post about inflammatory, controversial subjects without a Content Warning.</strong> Ideally, you would not post about inflammatory subjects at all. However, it may be acceptable to do so in some cases, but it is never acceptable to post inflammatory content without hiding the content behind an appropriate Content Warning.</li>
<li><strong>Do not post any type of nudity without a Content Warning.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Regarding Spam: We are not your free advertising platform.</strong> If you are here only to sell your products or services, you will be removed. Occasional posts of commercial links are OK, but when the vast majority of a user&#39;s posts are commercial in nature, we regard the account as a Spam account. Moderators will evaluate reports of Spam on a case by case basis.</li>
<li><strong>Do not engage in name calling</strong>, <a href=""https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ad%20hominem"">ad hominem</a> attacks, or any other uncivil behaviour. Criticize ideas, never people.</li>
<li><strong>Do not report every post that upsets you.</strong> Please report posts that violate our rules but for others that you may find distasteful, or just don’t like, use the tools available to you. You can block the user or mute the conversation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Moderation Principles</h2>

<p>Reported content will be assessed on a balance of probabilities by the moderators. In other words, whether it is more likely than not that the content violates one or more of these rules. Moderators will suspend an account from mastodon.world when the user demonstrates that they have breached any rule several times, or if their content (including profile description) suggests that they are likely to continue to break the rules. The number of breaches leading to suspension is deliberately not defined. In egregious cases, one breach can result in suspension of the user account.

The moderation team takes a pragmatic approach to every report they receive - if they feel that a problematic post isn’t explicitly a breach of any of these rules but is inappropriate for Mastodon.world, the post will likely be removed. Users who repeatedly post problematic content or otherwise are seen by the moderators as a negative, disruptive presence in our community can be removed at the discretion of the moderation team, even if those posts or the user did not explicitly violate our rules.</p>

<p>Wir möchten, dass dies ein angenehmer Raum für Menschen ist, die sich an Ideen und Meinungen anderer erfreuen und Spaß haben wollen. Wir arbeiten aktiv daran, hier eine Kultur von Freundlichkeit, Unterstützung und Respekt und insbesondere für marginalisierte Menschen einen möglichst entspannten Raum zu schaffen. Um das zu erreichen, werden die folgenden Regeln angewandt und durchgesetzt.</p>

<ul>
<li>aktiv gegen Rassismus, Sexismus, Homo- und Transfeindlichkeit vorgehen</li>
<li>den Server täglich sichern</li>
<li>mehr als eine Person Zugriff auf unsere Serverinfrastruktur hat</li>
<li>versprechen mindestens 3 Monate Vorwarnzeit zu geben, falls wir beschließen die Instanz abzuschalten. </li>

<p>Darüber hinaus gelten die folgenden:</p>

<h2>Regeln und Etikette</h2>

<p>Herzlich willkommen! Wir laden Dich herzlich ein, hier mitzumachen und bitten Dich, ein paar Dinge zu beachten. Wenn du unsere Regeln nachvollziehen kannst und gut damit zurechtkommst, ist das großartig. Wenn Du etwas davon nicht verstehst, dann recherchiere selbst oder frage uns. Wenn Du die Regeln nicht verstehen willst, suchst Du Dir aber besser einen anderen Ort. Dieser Text ist nicht allumfassend – bitte versuche nicht, Regellücken zu finden und auszunutzen.</p>

<h2>Sei du</h2>

<p>Wir feiern unsere Vielfalt! Du brauchst Dich hier nicht zu verstellen.  Sei Dir selbst treu und gib anderen den Raum, das Gleiche zu tun.</p>

<h2>Dinge teilen</h2>

<p>Sprich über Dinge, die Du vorhast oder fertig gestellt hast! Sprich mit anderen Leuten darüber, was sie vorhaben oder gemacht haben! Erstelle Dinge! Teile deinen Patreon, dein Crowdfunding oder deinen Shop! Poste deine Kunst! Empfehle oder booste Dinge, die du unterstützenswert findest! Bots sind willkommen, sofern sie sich an unseren Bot Leitfaden halten (s.u.).</p>

<h2>Ein Ort zum Lernen und Wachsen</h2>

<p>Wir nehmen uns Zeit, Regeln, Fachbegriffe oder Abkürzungen zu erklären, sind offen für Fragen und bieten unsere Hilfe an, wenn wir Kapazitäten dafür haben.</p>

<p>Wir fragen im Zweifelsfall nach (öffentlich oder privat), wie etwas gemeint ist, bevor wir darauf reagieren.</p>

<p>Wir üben konstruktive Kritik und bieten möglichst auch Lösungsvorschläge oder Alternativen an.</p>

<p>Wir geben einander (und uns selbst) Zeit, über Geschriebenes nachzudenken und erwarten keine sofortigen Antworten. Dies gilt insbesondere, wenn Konflikte entstehen.</p>

<p>Wir entschuldigen uns und ändern unser Verhalten, wenn wir Grenzen übertreten haben oder Regeln gebrochen haben.</p>

<h2>Eine inklusive und rücksichtsvolle Umgebung schaffen</h2>

<p>Wir gehen respekt- und rücksichtsvoll miteinander um. Wir gehen nicht davon aus, dass alle anderen dieselben Erfahrungen im Leben machen wie wir selbst.</p>

<p>Wir akzeptieren die Selbstdefinition aller Menschen. Dazu gehört auch, dass wir für sie die gewünschten Pronomen nutzen, sofern sie allgemein bekannt oder in deren Profil erkennbar sind.</p>

<p>Bitte verwende Bildbeschreibungen. Denke immer daran, dass viele Nutzer&ast;innen darauf angewiesen sind und dass wir Hürden aus dem Weg räumen wollen, die es diesen Nutzer&ast;innen unnötig schwer machen.</p>

<p>Verwende Inhaltswarnungen (Content-Warnungen; CWs) für sensible Inhalte. Was genau sensible Inhalte sind, ist schwer zu definieren und wir möchten keine Vorgaben machen. Aber wenn du vor dem Absenden eines Beitrages kurz nachdenkst, ob eine Content-Warnung sinnvoll sein könnte, tendiere eher zu &quot;Ja&quot; als zu &quot;Nein&quot;. Es gibt einige geläufige Abkürzungen für Content-Warnungen, die du vielleicht übernehmen willst: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>DEpol</strong> für <strong>pol</strong>itische Inhalten, die <strong>De</strong>utschland betreffen, analog für andere Länder, zB ATpol, CHpol etc.</li>
<li><strong>mh</strong> für <strong>M</strong>ental <strong>H</strong>ealth (psychische Gesundheit) Themen</li>
<li><strong>alc</strong> für Alkohol</li>
<li><strong>nsfw</strong> für Beiträge die Gewalt, Nacktheit, vulgäres thematisieren und meist grafisch Darstellen. Die Abkürzung steht für <strong>n</strong>ot <strong>s</strong>afe <strong>f</strong>or <strong>w</strong>ork, also &quot;nicht für den Arbeitsplatz geeignet&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>Menschen, die von Diskriminierungen betroffen sind, sind allerdings nicht verpflichtet, ihre Beiträge über diese Diskriminierungen mit Inhaltshinweisen zu versehen (freiwillige Kennzeichnungen sind natürlich trotzdem möglich).</p>

<p>Nutzt bei Bedarf bitte individuelle Filter oder schaltet einzelne Leute stumm, wenn ihr bestimmte Inhalte vorübergehend oder dauerhaft nicht sehen möchtet.</p>

<h2>Umgang mit Benachteiligungen und Privilegien</h2>

<p>Viele von uns sind in irgendeiner Form marginalisiert (d. h. strukturell benachteiligt) und von Diskriminierungen betroffen. Wir erfahren jedoch nicht alle dieselben Marginalisierungen. Oft haben wir gleichzeitig auch Privilegien im Vergleich zu anderen Menschen. Wir sind daher aufmerksam für unsere gesellschaftlichen Privilegien, das heißt: strukturellen Machtpositionen und dadurch ungleichen Zugang zu Ressourcen. Wir bemühen uns, bei unseren Aussagen und unserem Handeln diejenigen mitzudenken, die unsere jeweiligen Privilegien nicht teilen.</p>

<p>Menschen sind nicht verpflichtet, uns ihre Diskriminierungserfahrungen zu erklären. Wenn wir nicht wissen, wo wir uns zu einem Thema weiterbilden können, können wir allgemein nach Infoquellen fragen. Wer gerade Zeit und Kapazitäten hat, kann uns dann Dinge erklären oder mit Links o. ä. aushelfen. Es ist aber niemand verpflichtet, uns mit Weiterbildungsmaterial zu versorgen.</p>

<h2>Kein Platz für Diskriminierung und Hass</h2>

<p>Homo-, Bi- und Transfeindlichkeit und andere Formen von Queerfeindlichkeit, Rassismus, Behindertenfeindlichkeit, Sexismus und andere feindselige Einstellungen dieser Art akzeptieren wir hier nicht. Nazi oder TERF zu sein ist keine Meinung. Es ist beschissen, aggressiv und langweilig – geh damit woanders hin. Es steht Dir frei, Deine Meinung woanders zu äußern, wo niemand von uns Dich hören muss. Hier ist kein Platz für Hass. Dies wird von der Moderation streng durchgesetzt. Wir ermutigen unsere Community außerdem, Leute, die Hass verbreiten, individuell zu blocken.</p>

<p>Wenn wir feststellen, dass eine Instanz den Zweck hat oder massiv dazu genutzt wird, Leuten, die unserer Community Schaden zufügen, eine Heimat zu geben, werden wir darüber nachdenken, die ganze Instanz zu blocken (&quot;deföderieren&quot;). Das werden wir nicht leichtfertig und nur nach intensiver Abwägung tun. In der Regel sehen wir die individuelle Möglichkeit zu blocken, die alle einzelnen Anwender&ast;innen haben, als ausreichend an.</p>

<p>Belästigungen werden nicht geduldet, unterdrückerisches Verhalten wird nicht toleriert. Wenn Du die Grenzen Anderer nicht anerkennst, werden wir ggf. zunächst versuchen, Dich freundlich aufzuklären. Wiederholte Verstöße gegen unseren Verhaltenskodex, unsere Regeln und Etikette werden allerdings nicht toleriert und können im Ernstfall zur Löschung des Accounts führen.</p>

<p>Persönliche Angriffe sind unerwünscht. Der Wunsch nach einem freundlichen Umgangston rechtfertigt jedoch kein Tone Policing, wenn marginalisierte Menschen auf Diskriminierung hinweisen oder sie kritisieren.</p>

<h2>Halte dich ans Gesetz</h2>

<p>Maßgeblich sind die Gesetze in Deutschland. Insbesondere Copyright-Verstöße werden nicht geduldet. Wir behalten uns vor, gesetzeswidrige Inhalte nicht zu löschen, sondern zu sichern und anzuzeigen.</p>

<h2>Serversprachen sind Deutsch und Englisch</h2>

<p>Wir bitten dich um Verständnis dafür, dass wir ausschließlich deutschsprachige und englischsprachige Inhalte akzeptieren können, um unserer Verantwortung gegenüber der Community gerecht zu werden. Anderssprachige Inhalte können wir schlicht nicht ausreichend verstehen, um sie im Zweifel prüfen zu können.</p>

<h2>Moderation</h2>

<p>Aktuell gehören dem Moderationsteam <strong>5 (fünf) Personen</strong> an. Gib ihnen für Antworten und Aktionen bitte 24 Stunden Zeit. Dieser Server wird von Menschen in ihrer Freizeit betrieben. Hier findest du unser <a href=""https://pnpde.social/moderation.php"">Moderationskonzept</a>.</p>

<p>Um einen Beitrag zu melden, klick auf das Menü mit den 3 Punkten und dann auf &quot;melden&quot;. Du kannst einen oder mehrere Beiträge auswählen. Bitte füge auch eine Notiz hinzu, um der Moderation mitzuteilen, warum du die Beiträge meldest.</p>

<p>Das letzte Wort hat das Moderationsteam.</p>

<p>Wenn du mit jemandem aus dem Moderationsteam ein Problem hast, wende dich an <a href=""https://mastodon.pnpde.social/@spielleitung"">@spielleitung</a>. Wenn du mit @spielleitung ein Problem hast, wende dich ans Moderationsteam <a href=""https://mastodon.pnpde.social/@moderation"">@moderation</a>. Wir verpflichten uns dazu, auch unser eigenes Verhalten kritisch zu hinterfragen und uns bei Bedarf gegenseitig zu moderieren.</p>

<h2>Servermitteilungen</h2>

<p>Du solltest <strong>@spielleitung</strong> folgen. Der Account ist hauptsächlich dazu da, Neuigkeiten und Ankündigungen zum Betrieb der Instanz zu melden und  postet nur selten.</p>

I try to handle moderation ASAP, but it may take a few hours to handle your request/report.<br><br>
I am not a free speech absolutist, and there are instances available for that. I’m not interested in Nazis, TERFS, or hate speech of any sort, which I will define at my sole discretion. No homophobia, transphobia, queerphobia, racism allowed.<br><br>
This instance is meant to be a friendly, welcoming space to all who are willing to reciprocate in helping to create that environment.</p>

<p><b>Long Version</b><br>
The following guidelines are not a legal document, and final interpretation is up to the administration of super-gay.co; I am here to provide you with an insight into our content moderation policies:</p>

<p>The following types of content will be removed from the public timeline:
<ul>
<li>Excessive advertising</li>
<li>Uncurated news bots posting from third-party news sources</li>
<li>Untagged nudity, pornography and sexually explicit content, including artistic depictions</li>
<li>Untagged gore and extremely graphic violence, including artistic depictions</li>
<li>Racism or advocation of racism</li>
<li>Sexism or advocation of sexism</li>
<li>Discrimination against gender and sexual minorities, or advocation thereof</li>
<li>Xenophobic and/or violent nationalism</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The following types of content are explicitly disallowed and will result in revocation of access to the service:
<ul>
<li>Sexual depictions of children</li>
<li>Any conduct intended to stalk or harass other users, or to impede other users from utilizing the service, or to degrade the performance of the service, or to harass other users, or to incite other users to perform any of the aforementioned actions, is also disallowed, and subject to punishment up to and including revocation of access to the service.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><b>Content Warnings and Sensitive Media</b></p>

<p>The Content Warning (CW) policy is intended to make the server comfortable for the community.</p>

<p>Content Warnings are a feature of Mastodon that enable you to hide the body of a &quot;toot&quot; (post) behind a line of text. The intended use of this feature is to provide a way to discuss sensitive and/or potentially harmful topics without causing duress or harm to anyone who might stumble upon it, though content warnings may be used for a wide variety of reasons.</p>

<p>Images can be marked as sensitive. This is a feature which hides an image until a warning banner is clicked. Images may be marked as sensitive separately from Content Warnings, though using a Content Warning automatically marks the toot&#39;s images as sensitive.</p>

<p>Please note that our sensitive media rules apply to profile photos and headers as well. Since those images cannot be hidden behind sensitive media warnings, they are not allowed to contain content from enforced content warnings.
We cannot enforce content warnings on users from other instances, but can help to manage content that you see when reported to instance moderators.
Please be clear and accurate when labeling content warnings, to ensure that they follow both the letter and spirit of the enforcements that we have.
Above all, try to be polite, and come from a place of mutual respect when discussing content warnings with others.</p>

<p><b>Enforced Content Warnings:</b>
<ul>
<li>NSFW/sexual discussion and imagery must be behind descriptive CWs (nudity, sex, kink discussion, etc)</li>
<li>Sensitive imagery (please use your best judgement on what content that most other users would find sensitive, such as photos of surgeries, abuse, war, deceased individuals, etc)</li>
<li>Triggering topics (direct discussion of rape, trauma, abuse, suicide, transphobia, homophobia, etc.).</li>
<li>Drugs or drug use.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>I do not allow the promotion, advertisement, or sale of NFTs on this instance. I do not allow content from this instance, including content and media uploaded by the community members, to be sold as NFTs.</p>

413,63a0f57c1ed811d9ed0666f0,hear-me.social,False,466,"<p>This is a general-purpose Mastodon server administrated in the Greater Boston, Massachusetts area. All are welcome to sign up, so long as the rules are followed.</p>

<p>We federate with Threads, some do not. Read our <a href=""https://jerry.hear-me.blog/threads-and-hear-me-social-faq/"">Threads FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>While most Mastodon servers are limited to 500 character posts, here posts can be up to 12,000 characters because we think you have important things to write.</p>

<p>We also relay with over 1,500 other servers, some quite large. This means that we have all the active accounts and posts from those servers, in addition to the accounts and posts seen by people following and being followed here. So, while this server appears to have a moderate number of members, the experience and content is equal to the larger servers while having the benefits of a smaller instance: Stronger moderation, better protection, and consistent performance. How can we handle so many posts? We have unlimited storage.</p>

<p>You can see the incoming messages to here from all over the Fediverse by going here <a href=""https://hear-me.social/public"">Live feed</a></p>

<p>When signing up, you must read the quick, short, set of rules presented to you. Requesting an account is confirmation that you have read and agree to abide by our rules.</p>

<p><strong>Donations:</strong></p>

<p>Donations are appreciated, but are never required! They go toward supporting the 4 servers that I run, which are now averaging about $300/month. Besides this one, I also run:</p>

<p><strong>Things you MUST know before choosing a server</strong></p>

<p>When people choose a Mastodon server, I don&#39;t think they think much about it. They either find one listed on some website, or they want to go to the biggest. But, you should consider some other things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is it running the latest version? Currently, the latest Mastodon version is 4.2.8. The version number is in the lower left on the &quot;about&quot; page. Any server that has not upgraded either has an Admin incapable of doing it or isn&#39;t interested much in maintaining the server. This might mean your data isn&#39;t being backed up either, and you certainly are not getting the best experience. Reliability and security could become a concern. Please avoid servers that are running old versions. Some of the biggest are not updated.</p></li>
<li><p>Is it the biggest server? If you appreciate moderation, or you are in a targeted group, a huge server may not be best for you. A smaller server has more moderation. You also can get the Admin&#39;s attention when you need it. Performance on larger servers is not always the best either. And you may prefer a server that focuses on a particular interest rather than a general-purpose instance. We are general purpose.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p><strong>Important to know to get the most from Mastodon</strong>, is to understand the difference between hashtag use on Twitter and on Mastodon.</p>

<p>You can follow hashtags in Mastodon so that any posts visible to this server that have the hashtag, will appear in your timeline. You don&#39;t have to search for a hashtag as you do on Twitter.</p>

<p>Therefore, using hashtags in Mastodon is important if you want people in other instances to see your post. And it&#39;s a great way to be discovered and to discover other interesting people.</p>

<p>You can follow a hashtag by clicking on it within a post and then clicking the &quot;+&quot; in the top right corner.</p>

<p>On this server, the maximum number of characters in a post is 12,000. The Mastodon default is 500, but I bumped it higher. Also, note that a URL in a Mastodon post always counts as 23 characters, regardless of its true length. URL shorteners are not required for Mastodon posts.</p>

<p>Leaving Twitter? Add your Mastodon account name to your Twitter profile, so others can find you on Mastodon. Your Mastodon account name looks something like this: @jerry@hear-me.social</p>

<p>DMCA Takedown Notices: We adhere to the rules regarding DMCA Intellectual Property takedown notices. Please send notices to DMCA@hear-me.social. This email address is registered with the U.S. Copyright Office</p>

<p>This server prohibits posting copyright-protected materials, and we will remove these materials when notified. Anyone found posting copyrighted materials may or may not be notified prior to having their account suspended. A suspended account has 30 days to contact us, at <a href=""mailto:admin@hear-me.social"">admin@hear-me.social</a>, to appeal.</p>

<p>This server prohibits posting Child Sexual Abuse Materials (CSAM). Images are actively scanned. Their mathematical hashes are compared to the hashes of known CSAM images in the NCMEC.ORG database. Any matches are automatically reported, and the image is blocked. Nobody, nor any software, looks at the actual images, it&#39;s just a mathematical calculation on the bits.</p>

<p>While I do not believe anyone on this server posts CSAM material, since we relay with over 1,500 other servers, it is necessary to scan the images the server is exposed to.</p>

<p>Before submitting a copyright complaint to us, consider whether the use could be considered fair use. Fair use states that brief excerpts of copyrighted material may, under certain circumstances, be quoted verbatim for purposes such as criticism, news reporting, teaching, and research, without the need for permission from or payment to the copyright holder. If you have considered fair use, and you still wish to continue with a copyright complaint, you may want to first reach out to the user in question to see if you can resolve the matter directly with the user.</p>
<p>Please note that if you are unsure whether the material you are reporting is in fact infringing, you may wish to contact an attorney before filing a notification with us.</p>
<p>We may, at our discretion or as required by law, share a copy of your notification or counter-notification with third parties. This may include sharing the information with the account holder engaged in the allegedly infringing activity or for publication. If you are concerned about your information being forwarded, you may wish to <a href=""https://www.copyrighted.com/professional-takedowns"" target=""_blank"">hire an agent</a> to report infringing material for you.</p>
<h2 id=""notifications-of-infringement"">Notifications of infringement</h2>
<p>If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof, and you believe that any material available on our Services infringes your copyrights, then you may submit a written copyright infringement notification (&#8220;Notification&#8221;) using the contact details below pursuant to the DMCA. All such Notifications must comply with the DMCA requirements. You may refer to a <a href=""https://www.websitepolicies.com/create/dmca-takedown-notice"" target=""_blank"">DMCA takedown notice generator</a> or other similar services to avoid making mistake and ensure compliance of your Notification.</p>
<p>Filing a DMCA complaint is the start of a pre-defined legal process. Your complaint will be reviewed for accuracy, validity, and completeness. If your complaint has satisfied these requirements, our response may include the removal or restriction of access to allegedly infringing material as well as a permanent termination of repeat infringers&#8217; accounts.</p>
<p>If we remove or restrict access to materials or terminate an account in response to a Notification of alleged infringement, we will make a good faith effort to contact the affected user with information concerning the removal or restriction of access, which may include a full copy of your Notification (including your name, address, phone, and email address), along with instructions for filing a counter-notification.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any portion of this Policy, the Operator reserves the right to take no action upon receipt of a DMCA copyright infringement notification if it fails to comply with all the requirements of the DMCA for such notifications.</p>
<h2 id=""counter-notifications"">Counter-notifications</h2>
<p>A user who receives a copyright infringement Notification may make a counter-Notification pursuant to sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the US Copyright Act. If you receive a copyright infringement Notification, it means that the material described in the Notification has been removed from our Services or access to the material has been restricted. Please take the time to read through the Notification, which includes information on the Notification we received. To file a counter-notification with us, you must provide a written communication compliant with the DMCA requirements.</p>
<p>Please note that if you are not sure whether certain material infringes the copyrights of others or that the material or activity was removed or restricted by mistake or misidentification, you may wish to contact an attorney before filing a counter-notification.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any portion of this Policy, the Operator reserves the right to take no action upon receipt of a counter-notification. If we receive a counter-notification that complies with the terms of 17 U.S.C. § 512(g), we may forward it to the person who filed the original Notification.</p>
<h2 id=""changes-and-amendments"">Changes and amendments</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms related to the Website and Services at any time at our discretion. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. We may also provide notice to you in other ways at our discretion, such as through the contact information you have provided.</p>
<p>An updated version of this Policy will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Policy unless otherwise specified.

</ul>

<p>Linux.social prioritizes marginalized people&#39;s safety over privileged people&#39;s comfort. Linux.social moderators and admins will not take action on complaints regarding:</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Reverse&quot;-isms, including &quot;reverse racism,&quot; &quot;reverse sexism,&quot; and &quot;cisphobia&quot;.</li>

<li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as &quot;leave me alone,&quot; &quot;go away,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m not discussing this with you&quot;.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Our Responsibilities</h2>

<p>Linux.social moderators and admins are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.</p>

<p>Linux.social moderators and admins have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject posts, messages, comments, commits, code, or any other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.</p>

<p>Linux.social moderators and admins have the right to take certain action in response to any Linux.social community member exhibiting other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, harmful or causes damage to the reputation of the Linux.social community or Linux.Chat group of communities.</p>

<p>Examples of such actions include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Removal or limiting viewability of content posted to Linux.social.</li>
<li>A temporary, permanent or global ban from all Linux.Chat communities.</li>
<li>A temporary, permanent or global ban from applying for a Linux.social account in the future or global ban across the Linux.Chat group of communities.</li>
<li>A temporary, permanent or global ban from participating as a Linux.social moderator or admin or global ban across the Linux.Chat group of communities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>This Code of Conduct applies to all Linux.Chat community spaces, including Linux.social and Linux.community, herein collectively referred to as Linux.Chat:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Linux.Chat and Linux.Chat-related websites.</li>
<li>The Linux.Chat public and private mailing lists.</li>
<li>Any official public or private Linux.Chat forums or rooms on Matrix, IRC and Discord.</li>
<li>Any Linux.Chat public and private git repositories.</li>
<li>Any additional Linux.Chat project spaces or communities added in the future.</li>
</ul>

<p>When Linux.Chat community members contribute in discussion in or from our services, they represent the Linux.Chat community and its reputation.</p>

<p>Therefore, this Code of Conduct applies to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Public communication between Linux.Chat community members in community spaces of Linux®-related, free software projects or non-profits who are also Linux®-related community members.</li>
<li>Public communication between Linux.Chat community members at gatherings related to Linux.Chat and at Linux®-related events generally.</li>
<li>Public Linux.Chat social media posts and comments by Linux.Chat community members on those social media posts.</li>
<li>Private communication between Linux.Chat community members related to Linux.Chat communities or its members.</li>
<li>Private communication between Linux.Chat community members and Linux.Chat admins or moderators.</li>
</ul>

<p>This Code of Conduct also applies to official Linux.Chat communication, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using an official Linux.Chat e-mail address.</li>
<li>Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.</li>
<li>Posting via an official Linux.Chat social media account.</li>
</ul>

<p>Representation of our community may be further defined and clarified by Linux.Chat admins and moderators.</p>

<p>If a concern about a past incident in any space is made known to a moderator or admin about a current Linux.Chat community member, Linux.Chat moderators or admins may take it into account when deciding whether the incident should have any consequences to the community member&#39;s participation in the Linux.Chat community.</p>

<h2>Enforcement</h2>

<p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using the &quot;Report&quot; menu item on any post or profile in the Mastodon software (preferred).</li>
<li>Contacting Linux.Chat admins directly through the @admin@Linux.social account.</li>
<li>Contacting Linux.Chat admins or moderator privately through their official Linux.Chat community account.</li>
<li>Sending an email to <a href=""mailto:abuse@linux.chat"">abuse@Linux.Chat</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>All complaints will be reviewed and investigated as quickly as possible, and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The Linux.Chat admins and moderators are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.</p>

<h2>DMCA Takedown Notices</h2>

<p>DMCA takedown notices may be submitted to <a href=""mailto:dmca@linux.social"">dmca@Linux.social</a>.</p>

<p>Please ensure your DMCA takedown notice meets the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>The signature of the copyright owner or owner’s agent, in electronic form.</li>
<li>Identification of the: (i) copyrighted work(s) infringed; (ii) the infringing activity; and (iii) the location of the infringing activity (by providing the URL).</li>

<li>Linux.social will provide the posting party (24) hours to remove the content, should they fail to action this, we will remove the content within (24) hours;</li>
<li>The posting party then has the right to file a counter-notification, informing Linux.social that the content is not infringing; and</li>
<li>If a counter-notice is filed, the service provider must re-host the content unless the original copyright holder files a lawsuit.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Linux.social Inactive Account Policy</h1>

<p>In an effort to free up a wide range of account names, we may delete inactive accounts and associated personal data.</p>

<p>An account is considered inactive when:</p>

<ul>
<li>no posts have been made on the account and it has been at least twelve (12) months since the account was last accessed; or</li>
<li>it has been at least twenty-four (24) months since the account was last accessed</li>
</ul>

<p>For purposes of this policy, &quot;accessed&quot; means you have interacted with your account through one or more signed-in session from any device.</p>

<p>In order to warn the users concerned, an email will be sent to the e-mail address on file for the account providing the user twenty-one (28) days to reply and request an appeal for the account to be restored. Once an account has been deleted and the warning period has passed, it can no longer be recovered. To use Linux.social again, you&#39;ll need to create a new account.</p>

<h1>Server Policies and Information</h1>

<p>Our server policies and information can be contributed to via our <a href=""https://gitlab.linux.community/linux.chat/linux.social/server-information"">GitLab instance repository</a>.</p>

420,63b040146f1b2c0a97c45a46,mastodo.neoliber.al,False,280,"<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>This Mastodon instance was created in December 2022 for <a href=""https://reddit.com/r/neoliberal"">/r/neoliberal</a> as part of the broader <a href=""https://neoliber.al"">neoliber.al</a> domain as a reward for reaching a milestone during our <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/102ozbm/rneoliberal_2022_charity_drive_wrapup_thread/"">charity drive</a>. While primarily a spinoff of the subreddit, we welcome new accounts from anyone who is looking for a community based on liberal values</p>

<p>New to Mastodon? You can learn more about it <a href=""https://joinmastodon.org/"">here</a>. In short, this is an independently-run social media website that can communicate with other such websites using the ActivityPub protocol. If you create an account here, you can follow and chat with people on any other Mastodon instance and even on other social media platforms such as Lemmy and Pixelfed. This network is known as the &quot;Fediverse&quot; and is home to over 1.5 million monthly active users</p>

<p><a href=""https://mastodon.social/"">mastodon.social</a> is the most popular instance, so why make an account here? First, it gives you access to our <a href=""https://mastodo.neoliber.al/public/local"">local community feed</a> of people who have also decided to create an account here (100% good takes guaranteed or your money back). Second, as a small community, you can get direct support from the admins and a say in how moderation is handled. And lastly, thanks in part to the software <a href=""https://github.com/TheEssem/mastodon"">Chuckya</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/glitch-soc/mastodon/"">glitch-soc</a>, we have some extra features here not found on other Mastodon instances including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gigachad Obama emoji</li>
<li><a href=""https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs/features/rich-text/"">Markdown formatting</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs/features/local-only-toots/"">Local-only posts</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs/features/doodle/"">Doodle posts</a></li>
<li>Emoji reactions</li>
<li>Tenor GIF selector</li>
<li>Optional Mastodon Modern Theme (<a href=""https://codeberg.org/Freeplay/Mastodon-Modern"">source</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some Mastodon apps will not support all these features, but the website always works</p>

<h1>Moderation</h1>

<p>This instance is actively moderated and reports are usually responded to within 12 hours. We do not allow racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or bad stuff in general</p>

<p>As a user, Mastodon has powerful tools for deciding what content you want to see, including word filters, blocking accounts, and blocking entire instances. As such, our current policy is to only perform site-wide blocks of other instances for spam, harassment, hate speech, and illegal or otherwise highly-objectionable content. Please reach out if you think a server has been wrongfully blocked</p>

<p>In the future it may be possible to communicate with Bluesky and Threads. Some instances intend to block communication with these services because they&#39;re for-profit corporate entities, but we don&#39;t have any plans to do so</p>

<h1>Privacy</h1>

<p>We use the <a href=""https://mastodo.neoliber.al/privacy-policy"">default Mastodon privacy policy</a>. Please do not make an account here if you are under 13 or if handling your information as described in the privacy policy is otherwise illegal</p>

<p>It is not required to sign in to see posts made on this server. Therefore, blocking someone prevents them from replying to you, but does not stop them from reading your posts. This also means that posts made here can show up in search engine results or be archived by third parties (eg. <a href=""https://archive.org/web/"">Internet Archive&#39;s Wayback Machine</a>). This is the same as how Reddit operates. If you&#39;re looking for more privacy, you&#39;ll want to find a Mastodon instance that supports what&#39;s known as &quot;authorized fetch&quot;</p>

<h1>Administration</h1>

<p>A minimum of 90 days notice will be given if this instance is going to shut down, and backups are automatically performed daily. That said, we are not fully compliant with the <a href=""https://joinmastodon.org/covenant"">Mastodon Server Covenant</a> due to only one person having access to the server infrastructure</p>

<p>Server hosting and services are provided by Digital Ocean and Amazon AWS. Monthly costs are approximately $40. We are not accepting donations at this time, but if you would like to support the growth of Mastodon as a whole, consider contributing to the <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/mastodon"">Mastodon gGmbH Patreon</a> or another small instance</p>

<p>This instance is not affiliated with the Mastodon gGmbH nonprofit corporation. Accordingly, please direct all issues regarding the content on or moderation of this instance (eg. DMCA, GDPR, ban appeals, server blocks, tech support) to jenbanim@gmail.com</p>

<p>When AllThingsTech.social first launches, and for the foreseeable future, sign-ups will be limited and all users will have to be approved my staff before gaining access to the instance. This is being done to make sure everything runs as smoothly as possible, but to also ensure this instance remains a safe and friendly space for everyone.</p>

<p><em>AoIR Code of Conduct 0.5</em></p>

<h1>Operation</h1>

<p>The server is operated by @admin1@aoir.org. The instance agrees to abide by the <a href=""https://joinmastodon.org/covenant"">Mastodon Server Covenant</a>.</p>

<h1>Moderation</h1>

<p>We currently have around a dozen moderators located around the world. Our goal is to respond to community concerns swiftly. The instance subscribes to fediverse-recognized blocklists, including <a href=""https://codeberg.org/oliphant/blocklists"">Oliphaunt&#39;s Tier 0 List</a>. The admin account follows #fediblock and other hashtags and will block or silence instances based on the advice of respected fediverse admins.</p>

<h1>Funding</h1>

<p>This server is funded by the <a href=""https://aoir.org"">Association of Internet Researchers</a>, an academic association dedicated to the advancement of the cross-disciplinary field of Internet studies. It is a member-based support network promoting critical and scholarly Internet research independent from traditional disciplines and existing across academic borders. The association is international in scope.</p>

<p>The server is limited to dues-paying members of AOIR.</p>

<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>This is an instance for current members of the Association of Internet Researchers. Real names and credentials are only recommended if you plan to use your account on this instance for networking purposes; they are absolutely not required.</p>

<h2>Encouraged uses of AoIR.Social</h2>

<p>If you are an AoIR member in good standing, and you are willing to engage with others respectfully, and you will respect our community&#39;s efforts to make this a safe space for queer, trans, Indigenous, BIPOC, and other structurally disadvantaged people, you are absolutely welcome here. While this instance is hosted by a scholarly association, sociability &amp; posting about everyday life are just as welcome as professional networking, sharing research resources, and bragging about your publications.</p>

<p>First things first, please  introduce yourself. After signing up, post a message to the Local Timeline telling us who you are, what your academic interests are, and helping us to get to know you better. Use the #introduction tag.</p>

<p>And after introducing yourself, feel free to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Put your handle on the last slide of your conference presentations</li>
<li>Post a picture of your pets</li>
<li>Share your art and creativity</li>
<li>Engage in satire -- just must make a good-faith effort to punch up (&quot;Punching up&quot;: making jokes or criticism at the expense of those with more power, higher status or greater privilege.)</li>
<li>Engage in activism</li>
<li>Recruit participants for academic surveys—formal, IRB-approved ones or even informal ones (just make sure to use content warnings so that others can consent and don&#39;t get too obnoxious about it; see below for more about research on AoIR.social)</li>
<li>Share what&#39;s going on in your day</li>
</ul>

<h2>Content Warnings (CW&#39;s)</h2>

<p>One thing that differentiates Mastodon from other social media is the Content Warning affordance, which allows you to put a preview or warning about your post. This is useful for sensitive content, but can be used in other ways, too (e.g., jokes).</p>

<p>On AoIR.social, please add CW&#39;s (content warnings) that are accurate and descriptive enough to enable reader consent to the following types of posts:</p>

<ul>
<li>strong language,</li>
<li>rants,</li>
<li>selfies with eye contact,</li>
<li>current events (includes: US or non-US, local, national, international, and should be applied regardless of whether sources are academic or non-partisan), high-conflict or otherwise exhausting issues of popular debate (e.g. climate change, GMO&#39;s, privacy issues, elections, etc.),</li>
<li>mentions of death or violence,</li>
<li>photographs or illustrations of insects, genitals, wounds (even if they come from a scientific source)</li>
<li>spoilers of popular and recent TV shows or other media,</li>
<li>sexually explicit content,</li>
<li>ASCII art (this one is important to ensure that someone using a screen reader doesn&#39;t have to listen to an attempt to read out a bunch of obscure symbols)</li>
<li>stresses particular to academia such as grades, exams, thesis progress, academic job market prospects, and</li>
<li>anything else where another user might want to decide for themselves whether or when they want to interact with your post.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a setting in your preferences to open all posts with Content Warnings automatically, if you don&#39;t want to click through each one. CWs are a courtesy to fellow AoIR.social members as well as the broader fediverse.</p>

<h2>Image descriptions (alt-text)</h2>

<p>It is an expectation of this instance that you add accurate descriptions to all images and video that you post to aid in accessibility. (A description like &quot;image.jpg&quot; that does not aid in accessibility would not meet this expectation.)</p>

<p>If you post an image of a screenshot of text, it is an expectation of this instance that you transcribe the text in the image description. <a href=""https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/digital-accessibility/guides_tutorials/alternative_text/step-by-step-instructions-alt-text/index.php"">Here’s a guide on how and why to supply alt-text</a>.</p>

<h2>Unwelcome conduct on AoIR.Social</h2>

<p>The following will result in: a warning from the admin or having offending posts deleted, possibly without prior notice.</p>

<ul>
<li>Providing unsolicited advice to strangers</li>
<li>Inappropriate un-CW&#39;d posts on the Local Timeline (see above for CW policies)</li>
<li>Posts with un-described images or video</li>
<li>Shortened links, e.g. bit.ly, t.ly, tinyurl.com, goo.gl, ift.tt, lnkd.in, is.gd or t.co (These are considered malicious because link-shorteners track users without their consent and obscure the destination address, which also prevents users from being able to decide whether they want to visit the link beforehand)</li>
<li>Advertisement or spruiking for cryptocurrencies, NFT&#39;s, or multi-level marketing schemes</li>
<li>Unrequested solicitations to join religious, political, or other ideologically-defined organizations</li>
</ul>

<p>Exceptions:</p>

<p>DOI links (e.g. <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.k959"">https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.k959</a>) are allowed but the post must accurately describe the title/author/journal to allow the reader to decide for themselves whether they would like to follow the link. (In cases of very long titles, you may truncate it, and in cases of long author lists, &quot;First-Author et al&quot; will do.) Posts with DOI links where the target of the link is not described, or not described sufficiently, may be deleted without warning.</p>

<p>Discussion of research about cryptocurrencies is of course allowed.</p>

<h2>Things that will get your account closed, possibly without warning</h2>

<ul>
<li>Conduct that would violate the Association of Internet Researchers conference Code of Conduct, and specifically the following, which is adapted from the clause on harassment: “We do not tolerate harassment in any form. Harassment includes, but is not limited to, offensive comments related to characteristics such   as gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices. It also includes deliberate  intimidation, stalking, and unwelcome sexual attention.” Violations can result in a permanent ban; you may not receive a prior warning.</li>
<li>Serious dishonesty that is hurtful to others (e.g. falsely representing oneself as a member of a minority; services offering to write academic papers to help students cheat; vaccine denialism; predatory conferences or journals; overt pseudoscience such as flat-earther-ism etc.)</li>
<li>Anything that could be described as &quot;spam&quot;</li>
<li>illegal content, especially child exploitation images or sexually explicit materials posted without the subject&#39;s consent </li>
<li>Impersonating other people</li>
<li>No bots and no &quot;institutional&quot; accounts operated by non-members please; AoIR.social is for people. The obvious exception is that the AoIR organization itself will post official communications here. Any official communications will be marked as such.</li>
<li>Accounts that automatically repeat a Twitter account, RSS feed, etc. must post to AoIR.social as Unlisted, not Public</li>
</ul>

<h3>Regarding attempts to abuse these anti-abuse tools and policies</h3>

<p>Do not attempt to weaponize our Community Standards or anti-abuse tools/policies against marginalized groups such as people of colour, women or queer people. Members of AoIR.social are expected to have the literacy to understand that &quot;reverse discrimination&quot; is not real, and so attempts to re-centre discussions of marginalized people around the feelings of the privileged will be taken as manipulative behaviour undertaken deliberately in bad-faith. (E.g. white people should not demand that people of colour put CW&#39;s on every discussion of race). Furthermore, the abuse of content moderation tools for targeted efforts to silence, smear, or otherwise harass any individual account holder, for any reason, will not be tolerated.</p>

<h1>Use of AoIR.Social for research</h1>

<p>Researchers who wish to study AoIR.social or our users by collecting data using the API or through any other means that does not involve an &quot;opt-in&quot; from individual users are required to submit their protocol, analysis plan and all relevant ethics approval documentation from their institutional review board or departmental internal review documentation by email to the AoIR Fediverse admin account. You may also be required to submit code you plan to execute so that it can be tested to ensure it does not degrade the quality of service to other users.</p>

<p>This does not apply to, e.g. surveys circulated on AoIR.social that individual users can consent to participating in. This does apply to database scraping software, or any means of recording user activity where our users might be surprised that they were included afterward, because they were not given a chance to consent.</p>

<p>AoIR is well known for being the leading organization developing ethical online research. Ethical research on this instance (and much of the fediverse) should be sensitive to the privacy expectations of its members. Many people came to the fediverse in order to avoid being included in unethical social media research, and so we place a higher value on conducting research on human subjects with informed consent than most other social media, in order to maintain high ethical standards.</p>

<p>At the admin&#39;s discretion, you may be asked to submit your research protocol, and the institution that is providing ethical review, even in the case that it is an opt-in survey. Failure to disclose your research plan may result in closure of your account, or having your network banned from our service.</p>

<h1>Account Cancellation due to Lapsed Membership</h1>

<p>If your AoIR membership has lapsed for longer than 1 year, you will be contacted about renewing your membership. If you choose not to renew, you will have 60 days to download your data. You may move your data to another Mastodon instance.</p>

<h1>Version History</h1>

<p>Version 0.1: Edited by AoIR Executive Committee in Google Docs</p>

<p>Version 0.2: Posted to AoIR.social, 20230312</p>

<p>Version 0.3: Edited after consultation with AoIR.org moderators, 20230325. </p>

<p>Version 0.4: Edited after second consultation with AoIR mods + aligning this COC with conference COC, 20230326. Changes include:</p>

<p>Version 0.5: Slight edit to remove call for CWs on posts about social media. Because this is the Association of Internet Researchers, our members will talk about their work, no doubt. However, we can also encourage use of CWs in the &quot;current events&quot; sense -- e.g., if there&#39;s a lot of news about Meta, for example, members can be encouraged to use CWs at those times.</p>

<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>We expect everyone joining radikal.social to be aligned with the general goal of the instance as described above. At the same time, we realize that &quot;the radical left&quot; isn&#39;t a unanimous group and that disagreements and opposites exist within our movement.</p>

<p>Therefore we have specified how we moderate the instance here.</p>

<h2>How we moderate</h2>

<p>Every report is reviewed individually. We always initiate a dialogue with the reported account explaining why we think their behaviour is wrong and which actions we plan to take.</p>

<p>We differentiate between ignorance and malicious intent and want to give people the chance to learn and better themselves. If you have been reported we expect you to participate in the dialogue we initiate with you.</p>

<h2>What we moderate</h2>

<p>This is not a complete list of what we don&#39;t want on the server as such a list could never exist. Instead, we rely on trusting the reports we receive and listening to the people being harmed. </p>

<ul>

</ul></p>

<p>No harassment in other forms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No pornographic and/or sexualized images depicting people who did not consent to their image being shared</li>
  <li>No threats of violence or incitement of violence towards any individual (including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm)</li>

  <li>No continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease</li>
  <li>No purposeful misinformation</li>

<h2>What we don't moderate</h2>

<p>We prioritize marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. This means that we will not act on reports regarding:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’ (because these things don’t exist)</li>
  <li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”</li>
  <li>Refusal to explain or debate social justice concepts</li>
  <li>Communication in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reporting</h2>

<p>We rely on user reports to be able to moderate the instance. Reports should contain links, explanations, or other information that is relevant to the report. </p>

<p>A report does not guarantee the moderation response that you&#39;ve requested. If reporting users are not satisfied with our decisions, we suggest using the Mute or Block functions.</p>

<p>We will do our best to follow up within a reasonable time frame.</p>

<p>Instructions on how to report a post can be found <a href=""https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moderating/"">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Blocking & muting</h2>

<p>We encourage users to make use of the block and mute options to help control what content appears on their timelines. While moderators will do our best to block bad offenders and defederate from toxic instances, we recognize that people have different limits and expectations of the fediverse, and these options allow for a more personalized experience. </p>

<p>Instructions on how to use personalized Block and Mute controls can be found <a href=""https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moderating/"">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Content Warnings</h2>

<p>Please use Mastodon&#39;s built-in Content Warning (CW) tool to label posts that other users may find upsetting. The following must always be labelled with a content warning:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Visual depictions of physical violence, blood, severe injuries, torture, murder, or medical procedures</li>
  <li>Mentionings of suicide, self-harm, abuse, rape, or sexual assault</li>
  <li>Pornographic content and detailings of sexual acts</li>
  <li>Spoilers (within reason)</li>
</ul>

<p>Accounts that regularly post these types of posts without Content Warnings may have their accounts silenced, or suspended, based on the severity of the behaviour, and may be asked by the moderators to migrate to another instance.</p>

<p>All users are encouraged to be considerate of others’ needs and preferences. Please listen and respect if someone asks you to label a post with a content warning.</p>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>

<p>We encourage the usage of captions and descriptive text when posting images, to make your posts more accessible to users who use screen readers.</p>

<p>For the same reason, we also discourage the usage of excessive emojis or unicode text symbols in posts or usernames.</p>

<h2>Privacy</h2>

<p>Posts on Mastodon are not end-to-end encrypted and IPs and other metadata are recorded when you use the site.</p>

<p>Therefore, radikal.social (as well as any other instance) should not be used to send sensitive information or post things you wouldn&#39;t post publicly anywhere else on the internet.</p>

<p>You have four different levels of publishing to choose from when posting. You can read about them <a href='https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/posting/#privacy'>here</a>.</p>

<p>You can choose if you want to require follow requests and if you want your account to be suggested to others under your <a href='https://radikal.social/settings/profile'>profile settings</a>.</p>

<p>By default, your profile is indexed by search engines. You can change this in your settings <a href='https://radikal.social/settings/preferences/other'>here</a>.</p>

<p>Read the full Privacy Policy <a href=""https://radikal.social/privacy-policy"">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Who runs and moderates radikal.social?</h2>

<p>As mentioned in the intro we are a group of activists who created the server. We are organized in a semi-open group and intend to keep a constant flow of people in and out of the moderation team to ensure a distribution of power and to keep the group representative of different positionalities.</p>

<p>If you are interested in becoming a part of the group feel free to reach out to us. Between 6-12 months (from March 2023) we will invite to an open meeting for every user on the server, where a new moderation team can be formed, and the future of the instance can be discussed.</p>

<p>As the moderation team, we are dedicated to keep improving our policy and moderation. We are accountable for the moderation we perform. Any feedback or criticism is very welcome!</p>

<h2>CODE OF CONDUCT</h2>

<p>You have to follow the rules to use this instance. I don&#39;t want to get our instance suspended by other instances and want this to be a pleasant place to be. Please follow our rules and try to be courteous to the fediverse culture in public posts. The rules are available in the &quot;server rules&quot; tab below.</p>

<p>Explicit pornographic content must use a Content Warning, but the extent that you use other CWs is up to you. It is encouraged to CW common topics that bother people when posting on Public. <strong>Public posts will show up to people who do not follow you</strong> on the federated/local timelines, so be courteous.</p>

<p><strong>Unlisted</strong> posts will show up for non-followers if someone reblogs your post, but I think that should be up to the sharer to decide if they want to share an non-CW&#39;d post to their followers. * Please note that people can see unlisted posts if they visit your profile.</p>

<p><strong>Followers-Only</strong> posts are only visible to logged-in followers and cannot be reblogged. It&#39;s up to you if you want to CW these, only your followers will be able to see them.</p>

<h2>FEDERATION POLICY</h2>

<p>Denden will blacklist instances that foster <strong>hate-speech, harassment, CSAM (child sex abuse material), or anything else that is illegal to host in the United States.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Denden does not use pre-made instance blocklists.</strong> There have been too many occasions of blocklists being manipulated by bad actors to include innocent people for me to trust them. Blocked instances are individually vetted by the admins.</p>

<p>We will not blacklist instances based on <strong>&#39;guilt-by-federation&#39;:</strong> if an instance federates with a &quot;bad&quot; instance, but otherwise does not foster bad behavior (racism/harassment/etc), it will not be blacklisted.</p>

<p>We will also not blacklist an instance solely based on <strong>disputes with admins.</strong> The actions of admins do not necessarily represent the views of regular users on the instance.</p>

<p><strong>Denden&#39;s rules are designed to both foster a pleasant community as well as minimize the likelihood of being blacklisted by other instances.</strong> The content mentioned in rule 4 is illegal in France, where many instances are hosted.</p>

<h2>INFO FOR DENDEN USERS</h2>

<p><strong>Other instances won&#39;t be suspended unless they foster hate-speech, harassment, or CSAM.</strong> You might see content that you don&#39;t like in the federated timeline. Make sure to set filters in your account settings.</p>

<p><strong>Instead of us suspending instances, I encourage you to curate your own instance blocklist.</strong> You can block an instance in the same way you can block a user, you will not see anything from the whole instance, and users in that instance will not be able to interact with you.</p>

<p>In the event I need to take the server down for good, I will give everyone at least <strong>3 months notice</strong> to export your data and migrate to another server.</p>

<h2>MODERATION</h2>

<p>If someone is being troublesome, please report them. If they&#39;re from another instance, I am able to block them from this instance.</p>

<p>マストドンは、分散型SNSです。
X(Twitter)とできることは似ていますが、以下の点が異なります。
<strong>マストドンが何なのかわからない</strong>という方向けに、簡単に説明いたします。</p>

<h1>X(twitter)とはどう違うのか</h1>

<p><img src=""https://i.gyazo.com/a145c183edf6b69e8efb0add65fe9669.png"" width=""150""></p>

<h2>アカウントの引っ越しができる</h2>

<p>Xは、中央集権型SNSです。そのため、どんなに使いづらくなっても<strong>「続けるか」「辞めるか」</strong>の選択に迫られます。</p>

<p>マストドンのような分散型SNSは、<strong>フォロワーを他サーバーにお引越しできる</strong>ため、気に入らなければお引越しすることができます。</p>

<details><summary>さらに詳しく</summary>
分散型SNSを理解するには、「ソフトウェア」と「サーバー」を分けて考える必要があります。<p>
X社は、「X(Twitter)」という「ソフトウェア」を独自開発し、それを運用する「サーバー」を自社で運用しています。
「マストドン」「ミスキー」もソフトウェアです。しかし、こちらを用いて、有志がそれぞれ「サーバー」を立てて運用しています。
そのため、「X」は「サーバー」が一つしかありませんが、「マストドン」「ミスキー」を使用してる「サーバー」は何千個とあります。
ゲームで例えるなら、「Minecraft」がソフトで、それを有志が「サーバー」を立てて運用している状態です。
どの「サーバー」に入るか選ぶ必要があるのは、このためなんですね。<p>
決定的に異なるのが、<b>異なるサーバー間、ソフトウェア間の通信が可能</b>なところです。ActivityPubという通信規格に沿って作られているサーバー、ソフトウェア間なら相互通信が可能です。つぶやきはもちろん、相互フォローなども可能なのです。さらにはフォロワーの引っ越しも可能なため、自分がいるサーバーが終了することになっても、他のサーバーに移ればよいのです。それに対してXは、一つのサーバーでしか運用されないため、有料化やAPIの高額化などの営利的な動きがあると、その影響から逃れることができません。ここがXとの大きな違いです。投稿自体は引っ越しできないため、アーカイブをエクスポートする必要があります。<p>


</details>

<h2>相手がどこにいてもフォローできる</h2>

<p>マストドンは、<strong>Misskeyとも相互フォローできます。</strong></p>

<p><strong>ActivityPub</strong>という機能に対応したサービスなら、相手がどこにいてもフォローすることができます。(Threadsも対応予定)</p>

<p>例えば、検索ボックスに
<strong>「@UN_NERV@unnerv.jp」</strong>
と検索をかけると、<strong>「unnerv.jp」</strong>サーバーにある特務機関NERV 防災情報をフォローすることができます。</p>

<details><summary>もっと詳しく</summary>

マストドンは、分散型SNSと呼ばれるサービスの一つです。
仕組みとしては電子メールと似ており、遠くの人へもつぶやきが届けられるのが最大の特徴です。<p>

メールは、同じGoogleアカウント同士じゃなくても、outlookやyahooのメールサービスにも届けられますから、それととても似てます。
そのため、ActivityPubという通信規格に対応したMisskeyとの相互フォローが可能です。
IDが「ID名@サーバーURL」という形式になっているのも、メールと共通点がありますね。<p>

似たようなものにBlueskyが採用してるAT Protocolがありますが、こちらはまだ開発中で実用に至っておらず、まだ利用できる段階ではありません。<p>

そのような中で、Meta社のThreadsがこのActivityPubに対応すると予告しており、今後はActivityPubが発展していく可能性があります。

<h2>その他の特徴</h2>

<li>広告が流れない</li>
<li>投稿を編集できる</li>
<li>Tweet Deckのような複数列の表示にも対応</li>
<li>鍵アカウントにしなくてもフォロワーのみ見れる投稿</li>
<li>APIが無料のため、スマホアプリが数多く現存している</li>
</ul>

<h2>Misskeyとどう違うのか</h2>

<p><img src=""https://i.gyazo.com/b634b1e7ea8d18c15ebbbaf1c9695886.png"" width=""150""></p>

<p>Misskeyは、マストドン同様に分散型SNSソフトウェアの一つです。</p>

<p>絵文字リアクションを代表する多機能なMisskeyとは異なり、<strong>マストドンはシンプルな設計になっています。</strong>そのため、動作が軽めです。
また、スマホの<strong>公式クライアントアプリ</strong>が配信されているのもマストドンの特徴です。</p>

<h2>「ローカル」「連合」とは</h2>

<p>マストドンには <strong>「ホーム」「ローカル」「連合」</strong> の3つのタイムラインがあります。</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>「ホーム」</strong>...いつものタイムラインです。</li>
<li><strong>「ローカル」</strong>...このサーバーのユーザー全員参加のタイムラインです。</li>
<li><strong>「連合」</strong>...他サーバーのユーザーも表示される賑わいのあるタイムラインです。(対応検討中)</li>
