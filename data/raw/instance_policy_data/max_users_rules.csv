<h3>Account Registrations</h3>

<p>If you are wanting to create an account on tooters.org you can request an invite from one of our community members. If you do not have an existing relationship with anyone on our instance you can send us an <a href=""mailto:hello@tooters.org"">email</a>.</p>

<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>Last updated August 14th, 2023:
<a href=""https://home.tooters.org/privacy/"">home.tooters.org/privacy</a></p>

<h3>Administration &amp; Moderation</h3>

<p>The co-admins are <a href=""https://tooters.org/@sandy"">Sandy</a> and <a href=""https://tooters.org/@victorwynne"">Victor</a>.</p>

<h3>Donate</h3>

<p>If you would like to support the operational costs for this service, 100% of what you contribute on <a href=""https://ko-fi.com/tooters"">ko-fi.com/tooters</a> will do so.</p>

<h3>Automated Accounts</h3>

<p>New bot accounts are not allowed. These existing ones publish to our local timeline:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://tooters.org/@dpx442"">@dpx442</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://tooters.org/@indieblog"">@indieblog</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Direct Messaging</h3>

<p>Be aware that posts sent to ‘mentioned people only’ are not encrypted, and therefore should not be considered private.</p>

<h3>NSFW Content</h3>

<p>Profile avatars, and header images may not be sexually explicit, depict violence, or contain any such imagery.</p>

<p>Sexually explicit material must have a content warning applied to mark it as sensitive so that the local timeline stays safe for work.</p>

<h3>Accessibility</h3>

<p>Being considerate of people who require tools such as screen readers is the only way to be a welcoming community. For that reason:</p>

<ul>
<li>All media posts should have alt text included.</li>
<li>All multi-word hashtags should be capitalized.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example: #streetphotography is not discernible to a screen reader, but #StreetPhotography is.</p>

<h3>Fundraising</h3>

<p>It is common on the fediverse for people to seek financial support, or raise money for various causes. Some people do not want to see this type of content, and adding a hashtag to the post that can be muted helps to achieve this. At the same time people who are seeking to help others will search related hashtags increasing exposure of the post.</p>

<h3>Account Retention</h3>

<p>In the event that Tooters announces we plan to discontinue operating our instance; new account registrations will close, and current account holders will be given <strong>six months advanced notice</strong> so that they can be assisted in migrating their account to a different provider. §</p>
