<h3>Guidelines</h3>

<p>On social.tchncs.de our primary directive is:<br> <span style=""font-weight:bold;"">→ &quot;Be nice to each
        other!&quot;</span></p>

<p>Please remember there are real people on the other side of the screen, and those people may have different feelings
    and opinions and experiences than you do. Some of them may be tired or having a bad day. Or you might.</p>

<p>You don&#x27;t have to agree with someone to be civil to them. If you can&#x27;t be civil to someone, leave them
    alone.</p>

<p>If you don&#x27;t wish to interact with someone, or see any of their posts, there are tools at your disposal
    including mute and block functions.</p>

<p>If someone&#x27;s posts make you angry or upset, take some time to calm down before you reply. You might also try
    simply excusing yourself from a conversation and ask them to untag you if you no longer wish to discuss a topic.</p>

<div style=""padding-top:1em;""></div>

<p>When someone asks you to leave them alone, leave them alone. If you feel like you can&#x27;t control your urge to
    respond to that person, use the block or mute feature so you won&#x27;t see their posts and be tempted.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that while you cannot control other people&#x27;s behavior, you are still responsible for your own
    conduct, even if you feel someone was rude to you or someone else.</p>

<p>We will not allow abusive or disruptive conduct by or toward users on social.tchncs.de. This includes continuing to
    engage in conversation with someone who has specifically requested you leave them alone, inciting other users to
    engage with that person on your behalf, aggregating and posting another person&#x27;s personal information without
    their consent, and inciting others to engage with that person on other platforms. Blocking someone and then sitting
    on the other side of a block and continuing to talk about that person is also a provoking behavior.</p>

<p>Before you post, think about whether this is the kind of thing you would like to see (or would like your mom or kids
    to see) in the public timeline. There are post visibility settings that give you some control over which timelines
    your post appears in, and also CW and NSFW buttons to hide specific text and images in your post. Be a good social
    media neighbor and use these functions when appropriate.</p>

<p><hr class=""spacer"">
<p>Content not allowed on social.tchncs.de</p>
<ul class=""bullet"">
        <li>Sexual depictions of children</li>
        <li>Content illegal in Germany and&#x2F;or France, such as holocaust denial or Nazi symbolism; Antisemitism, Antiziganism or related. </li>
        <li>Conduct promoting the ideology of National Socialism</li>
<li>Content that is considered to be misinformation/conspiracy</li></ul>
<hr class=""spacer"">
<p>Content which will be removed from the public timeline:</p>
<ul class=""bullet"">
        <li>Excessive advertising</li>
        <li>Untagged pornography- and sexually explicit content</li>
        <li>Untagged gore and extremely graphic violence</li>
    <p>We will also remove any content we judge to be hateful toward specific individuals or groups, or intended to
        cause or incite harm from the public timeline. This includes Ableism. </p></p>

<p>This guideline is intentionally vague because we do not intend to play &quot;rules lawyer&quot; on the subject
        of what it is and isn&#x27;t okay to say about people. A good rule of thumb is, if you&#x27;re about to say
        something you think might fall foul of this rule, you probably shouldn&#x27;t say it. ☺</p>

<p></ul>
<hr class=""spacer"">
<p>Timeline Flooding</p>
<p>In order to keep the best user experience, we ask you not to send like twenty toots in two minutes (exemplification)
    as people want to be able to see more than just one user in their timelines.<br>
    Of course we understand and may do an exception for critical reasons of yours like a kind of serious emergency
    situation for example.</p>
<hr class=""spacer"">
<p>Crossposting</p>
<p>Your account must not be used as a sole mirror of some other platform: by having an account on this server, the team and fellow users expect to interact with – and read from – a real and authentic person.
    We understand that you might want to also crosspost from other platforms, but we also ask you to not do that exclusively.</p>
<hr class=""spacer""></p>

<p>Reporting / Moderation Notes</p>

<p>If you see content which you believe is in breach of these rules, please report it for review,<br> it is very
    important for us, as it makes our work easier and this instance a more enjoyable place.<br>
    Please note however that repeately falsely reporting users is not welcomed and are treated as feature-abuse.<br><br>
    In case you broke our rules by mistake, we may try to reach out to you so please make sure not to block the team of
    social.tchncs.de.</p>

<p><hr class=""spacer""><em>These guidelines are not a legal document, they&#x27;re here to provide you with an insight into

<p><hr class=""spacer"">
<h3>Federation status</h3>
<p>social.tchncs.de does not believe in censorship. Federation is a network service and suspension of federation with
    another server will only be implemented as a last resort where content from another server may cause problems under
    German law, or in cases of technical difficulties or hostile or malicious activity. If we need to suspend
    federation or silence another instance for one/some of these reasons, it will be noted here (now further below). Did we make a wrong
    decision in your opinion? Ping us!</p></p>

<p><br>
<p>(Note: you can still communicate with users on silenced instances; their posts will not appear in our public
    timelines. You will not be able to see posts made by users on suspended instances.)</p>
<hr class=""spacer"">
<h3>Reporting an issue</h3>
<p>For technical issues, use the administrator contact information listed under &quot;Contact&quot;
For content or abuse issues:</p></p>

<ul class=""bullet"">
    <li>if you&#x27;re a user on social.tchncs.de you can use the &quot;Report Abuse&quot; function on the post you
        would like to report;</li>
    <li>If you&#x27;re not a user on social.tchncs.de, or you&#x27;re an administrator of another server who would like
        to discuss an abuse report you received about one of our users, please use the administrator email listed under
        &quot;Contact&quot;</li>

welcome on the octodon (it/they).<br />
this is our ship and it was built for Liberation, back in 2017 when i joined this federated ocean, to have a reliable space for myself and any friend who felt safer here.<br />
to be free from sexists, racists, transphobes, homophobes, ableists, eugenicists, capitalists, classists, nazis, liberals, and self-sufficient libertarians all the same. they will be shot on sight and without trial or warning or mercy. all cops are bastards, all terves will die alone, all nazis shall be skinned first.<br />
this is a place where we can live and express ourselves freely as oppressed masses of violent systems; it is about seizing our social media and having a place to accompany us thru our struggles, where freedom is about punching up, not down or sideways.<br />
a feminist, anarchist, communist, cyberpunk culture, with many trans and queer people, often with tech or scientific interests.
if you're a part of it, i will fight for you and by your side. if you betray us, you will be thrown overboard.<br />
we use the defederation cannon often & easily; any instance that will inflict such pains on me or my users will be suspended as we see fit. free speech types are not on thin ice, our hull will go right thru them.<br />
<br />
registrations are closed because unlimited growth is not sustainable and octodon is already pretty big, but members can share invites. this link of trust eliminates most of the spam issue and ensures a slow-paced organic growth. <br />
    <br />
    additionally to this,<br />
<b>* please do not flood the local timeline</b>; it's good that there's a bit of everyone in there and in moderation. it's especially important for bots.<br />
<b>* bot accounts:</b> are allowed, but i would like to be asked first, and it has to be of public interest or a personal project of yours. if it posts frequently, consider auto-deleting the posts after a while to free space.<br />
<b>* content warnings: are encouraged</b>, with no strict requirements except for public timelines (porn & violence). this is foremost between you and who will see your posts<br />

  <li><b>Do not use bots to abuse other people. <a href=""https://www.crummy.com/2013/11/27/0"">Bots should punch up</a>, not down.</b></li>

  <li>If you run a bot here, please be kind to the servers. If the
    instance starts to bog down, bots that are making excessive API calls
    will be disabled.</li>
  <li>Please be mindful of the tools that Mastodon provides to mask
    potentially troubling content from users. If appropriate, please use
    content warnings, and consider not placing your toots in the public
    timeline.</li>
  <li>The following types of content are forbidden, and posting them
    will result in immediate termination of your account:

</li>
  <li>Furthermore, your bot might be suspended for things not listed here if the moderators decide it is inappropriate. If you have any questions about potential bots, please feel free to ask.</li>
</ul>

<br /><br /><br />

<p>Here are some more detailed rules for the instance:</p>


<h2>Our Goal</h2>

<p>This community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free
  experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants
  in any form.</p>

<h2>Applicability and Scope</h2>

<p>This code of conduct applies to all of this community's spaces,
  including public channels, private channels and direct messages, both
  online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be
  sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the
  administrators.</p>

<h2>Toward a Welcoming and Safe Environment</h2>

<p>We hope to create an environment in which diverse individuals can
  collaborate and interact in a positive and affirming way. Examples of
  behavior that contributes to creating this sort of environment
  include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using welcoming and inclusive language</li>
  <li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</li>
  <li>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</li>
  <li>Focusing on what is best for the overall community</li>
  <li>Showing empathy towards other community members</li>
</ul>

<h2>Anti-Harassment Statement</h2>

<p>This community will not tolerate harassment of any kind. Examples
  of harassment include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, pregnancy status, veteran status, political affiliation, marital status, body size, age, race, national origin, ethnic origin, nationality, immigration status, language, religion or lack thereof, or other identity marker. This includes anti-Indigenous/Nativeness and anti-Blackness.</li>
  <li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, relationships, drugs, and employment.</li>
  <li>Deliberate misgendering, using inappropriate pronouns, or use of ""dead"" or rejected names.</li>
  <li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where they're not appropriate.</li>
  <li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like ""hug"" or ""backrub"") without consent or after a request to stop.</li>
  <li>Threats of violence.</li>
  <li>Incitement of violence towards any individual or group, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.</li>
  <li>Deliberate intimidation.</li>
  <li>Stalking or following - online or in the physical world.</li>
  <li>Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.</li>
  <li>Sustained disruption of discussion.</li>
  <li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
  <li>Patterns of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.</li>
  <li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.</li>
  <li>Deliberate ""outing"" of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.</li>
  <li>Publication of non-harassing private communication.</li>
  <li>Jokes that resemble the above, such as ""hipster racism"", still count as harassment even if meant satirically or ironically.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have questions or concerns about these issues please feel free to message an admin or ask for an opportunity to explore the issue with a moderator and volunteers.</p>

<h2>Reporting</h2>

<p>If you think that an account on this instance is violating this Code of Conduct, or is doing something offensive or should be otherwise handled by the administrators, the easiest way to report them is to use the reporting tool that is part of Mastodon. You can do that using the 'Report' tool which is embedded in every toot:
  <br>
    <img src=""/report.png"" />
</p>

<p>If you would rather not use the reporting tool, if the harassment
  is happening outside of botsin.space, or if you have any other
  concerns, please contact the administrators via the methods listed at
  the top of this page. If the person who is harassing you is on the
  admin team, they will not be involved in handling or resolving the
  incident.</p>

<p>The admin team will respond to any complaint as promptly as
  possible we can. If you do not get a timely response (for example, if no admins are currently online) then please put your personal safety and well-being first, and consider logging out and/or contacting the admins by email at colin at muffinlabs dot com.</p>

<p>This code of conduct applies to our community's spaces, but if you
  are being harassed by a member of our community outside our spaces, we
  still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of
  harassment by our members, especially the administrators,
  seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment
  that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the
  right to exclude people from the community based on their past
  behavior, including behavior outside of our spaces and behavior
  towards people who are not in this community.</p>

<p>In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve
  the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad
  faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted
  without response.</p>

<h2>Enforcement Process</h2>

<p>Every code of conduct violation report will be treated with
  seriousness and care. If a member's immediate safety and security is
  threatened, an individual admin may take any action that they deem
  appropriate, up to and including temporarily banning the offender from
  the community. In less urgent situations, at least two admins will
  discuss the offense and mutually arrive at a suitable response, which
  will be shared with the offender privately. Whatever the resolution
  that they decide upon, the decision of the admins involved in a
  violation case will be considered final.</p>

<p>We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of
  protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a
  person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately
  warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will
  increase the safety of our members or the general public. We will not
  name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.</p>

<h2>Consequences</h2>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
  comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior,
  the administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to
  and including expulsion from the community and identification of the
  participant as a harasser to other members. At the discretion of the
  admins, or by request, one or more of the parties involved may request
  to discuss the violation and how to avoid similar situations in the
  future.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p> Nous sommes très heureux de faire parti du projet Mastodon et nous ferons de notre mieux pour garder cette instance disponible. Nous mettons à jour l'instance quelques jours après la sortie d'une nouvelle version, et nous réalisons une sauvegarde journalière de l'instance sur un stockage externe.</p> 

<h4>Fonctionnement</h4>

<p>
Nous soutenons la liberté d'expression, et c'est pourquoi nous ne bloquerons pas d'instance ou d'utilisateur sans raison valable (objective et raisonnable). <br>
Il est possible que nous mettions certaines instances en silencieux, pour ne pas recevoir l'ensemble des messages dans le flux principal de l'instance, mais nous ne bloquerons que les instances non modérées qui n'agissent pas pour supprimer des contenus répréhensibles de manière répétée.</p>

    </li>
    <li>No stalking or harassment</li>

    </li>
    <li>No ""follow bots."" We block these and our instance is on a ""no bots"" list.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=""handling-harassment"">Handling harassment</h2>

<p>If you are being harassed, please report the user using the ""…"" button and then ""Report."" For urgent concerns, please
    DM a moderator.</p>

<p>If you engage in harassing behavior, the moderator may take any action they deem appropriate, such as a warning or an
    expulsion.</p>

<p>The above rules may change at any time, and you may be banned at any time based on the moderators' judgment.</p>

<h2 id=""privacy-policy"">Privacy policy</h2>

<p>What will we do with your data? Nothing. How will you be influenced by advertisers? You won't; brands and non-humans
    (other than fun/useful bots) are banned. How will we aggregate your data in order to improve your service… none of
    that.</p>

<p>We will never share your data with anyone else, except in the case of valid legal requests if it comes to that.
    (Hopefully it won't come to that!)</p>

<p>More privacy measures on toot.cafe:</p>

<ul>
    <li>EXIF data (GPS location, date, camera type, etc.) is <a href=""https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/85"">stripped
        from images</a> and never stored.
    </li>
    <li>All crawlers are <a href=""https://github.com/tootcafe/mastodon/pull/1"">blocked in <code>robots.txt</code></a>.
    </li>
    <li>HTTPS is used everywhere thanks to <a href=""https://letsencrypt.org/"">Let's Encrypt</a>.
    <li>No ads or trackers.</li>
    <li>Links are direct URLs rather than tracking redirects.</li>
</ul>

<p>Understand though that this instance is run by me and my friends, and (as is the case with all Mastodon servers) we
    potentially have access to your data, including DMs. The back-end is also not encrypted. If this is not okay with
    you, this might not be the instance for you.</p>

<p>Also, for truly private data sent between two people, Mastodon offers no E2E encryption. So use Signal or Matrix
    for the things you really want to be private.</p>

<h2 id=""discussion-and-feedback"">Discussion and Feedback</h2>

<p>For questions about policy, bots, design, theming, etc., please refer to our <a
        href=""https://github.com/tootcafe/discussions"">discussions GitHub repo</a>.</p>

<h2 id=""blocked-instances"">Blocked instances</h2>

<p>We block some other instances. I used to maintain a list here for transparency, but later decided it's not really worth it. It just gives extra publicity to those instances (even if I attempt to hide the names somewhat) and invites drama.</p>

<p>Just know that we basically block the same instances that most other reasonable instances block. If you feel that something should be blocked, but isn't, reach out to a moderator and/or proactively block it yourself on your own account.</p>

<p>This is a generalist instance. Either you like Game of Thrones or not, either you support the house Targaryen or not, and whatever opinions you have, you will always be welcome. This instance was made because we believe in a better and decentralised (<i>sine qua non</i> condition) Internet. This instance also focus on security (through a strong TLS configuration) and performance.</p>

<p>This instance is up and running since the <em>1 April 2017</em>. We were one of the first Mastodon instances open to registrations and we're here for a long time...</p>

<p>All languages are accepted but the main languages spoken here are <em>french</em> and <em>english</em> (and valyrian for sure).</p><br>

<h3>Source code changes</h3>
<p>For your information, this instance is running a little different code than other Mastodon instances. Don't panic, it's still Mastodon, but as you can see the look is tweaked. Bio length was increased from 160 to 400. The current limit of characters per post is set to <em>800</em> (default is 500 for Mastodon) : we believe this is still a reasonable limit for micro-blogging.</p>

<h3>Rules</h3>

<p>There are no restrictions of content on this instance, however, to keep it pleasant to everyone here are a few rules.</p>

<p>Any user not respecting these rules may get silenced or suspended.</p>

<p>Also remember you have the ability to report users if they don't respect these rules.</p>

<ul>
<li>Racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. messages are prohibited</li>
<li>Parodic accounts are accepted but must mention they are parodic in their description</li>
<li>Bots are allowed. However, bots tooting in the public timelines may get silenced if they toot too much. Bots mentionning users too many times without their consent may get suspended.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to donate?</h3>

<p><em>Liberapay</em> : <a href=""https://liberapay.com/thekinrar/"">donate recurrently!</a></p>

<p><em>Patreon</em> : <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/thekinrar"">become a patron!</a></p>

<p>To guarantee the longevity of this instance, every single donation is useful.</p>

<h2>Модерационная политика</h2>

<ul>
<li>Основной язык ноды - русский. Допускаются посты на других языках.</li>
<li>Если учетная запись не подает признаков живого пользователя (как правило, наличие аватара и заполненного профиля, а также ответ на вопрос в личных сообщениях сразу после регистрации), запись подлежит полному погашению.</li>
<li>У ноды нет четко определенной тематики.</li>
<li>Hate speech (разжигание ненависти по признаку национальной, расовой, половой, гендерной, сексуальной или какой-либо иной врожденной принадлежности) приравнивается к недопустимому поведению, и подлежит удалению с сервера, в отдельных случаях вместе с погашением учетной записи-источника. Моральные уроды нам здесь не нужны.</li>
<li>Оскорбительные термины (такие как &quot;чурка&quot;, &quot;жид&quot;, &quot;черножопый&quot;, &quot;пидор&quot;, и подобные, и производные) влекут за собой внимание модераторского состава. Они не запрещены сами по себе, но часто являются маркерами hate speech.</li>
<li>Педофилам тут не рады. О сексе с дошкольниками и дошкольницами идите фантазировать куда-нибудь в другое место, будьте добры.</li>
<li>Минимальное количество предупреждений на аккаунт - 2, после чего при следующем нарушении возможно удаление аккаунта.</li>

<p>Meow is federated to nearly all instances of the fediverse, which means you can follow pretty much anyone you want, no matter what instance they are on!</p>

<p>While it is open publicly, mind this is just one instance in the fediverse, and we encourage you to look at other instances available to be sure it’s the one you like, and if none please you and you got the knowledge to set things up, why not help the fediverse grow by making your own instance too!</p>

25,58e64e285002cc7716dd4000,mastodon.me.uk,False,2541,"<h2><a name='welcome'></a>Welcome!</h2>

<p>
Welcome to Mastodon.me.uk, a social media community hosted in the UK; part of the Fediverse/ActivityPub/Mastodon federated social network, which allows you to follow users on other communities. It's a bit like Twitter but without a single company in control.</p>
<p>
If you're new to the Fediverse, the <a href='https://fedi.tips/mastodon-and-the-fediverse-beginners-start-here/'>FediTips beginners' guide</a> is a great introduction. 
</p>

<h3>Arriving from Twitter?</h3>

<p>
If you're coming from Twitter, here are a few useful tools:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Find people you know over there by connecting your accounts up to <a href=""https://fedifinder.glitch.me/"">Fedifinder</a> or <a href=""https://twitodon.com/"">Twitodon</a>.</li>
<li>Many thing you might consider ""missing features"" are intentional; for instance, quoting other posts is intentionally not possible. Try to get comfy and learn a bit about the space before suggesting it should change.<li>
</ul>

<h2>Fediverse Etiquette (Fediquette?)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Use content warnings on posts that people might prefer not to see (politics most often, but you'll see many other examples). It's easy and polite.</li>
<li>Don't crosspost indiscriminately between networks.</li>
<li>#PutHashtagsInCamelCase, it makes them easier to read for everyone.</li>
<li>Add descriptions to your images. <a href='https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-write-an-image-description-2f30d3bf5546'>Object-Action-Context</a> is a great method.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name='moderation'></a>How We Moderate Content</h2>

<p>
Your moderation team is <a href='https://mastodon.me.uk/@Floppy'>@Floppy</a>, <a href='https://mastodon.me.uk/@CatherineFlick'>@CatherineFlick</a>, <a href='https://mastodon.me.uk/@Darkedge'>@Darkedge</a>, <a href='https://mastodon.me.uk/@pauljrobinson'>@pauljrobinson</a>, and <a href='https://mastodon.me.uk/@jezhiggins'>@jezhiggins</a>. We hope to move to a democractically-elected mod team at some point when we work out how.
</p>

<p>
The moderation team on this instance are responsible for enforcing our Code of Conduct (see below). In general, our approach is to let people say what they like (unless clearly illegal), but prevent them saying it publicly where it can hurt others. We think that's best aligned with the principles of the Fediverse as a whole.
</p>

<ol>
<li>People that clearly breach UK law (or who are considered spammers by the mods) will be removed immediately.</li>
<li>People that attack other people or groups based on who they are (<em>not</em> for what they believe) will be suspended - that basically means they'll be silenced, and fully deleted after 30 days.</li>
<li>People that post offensive content, or who post regularly without using an appropriate content warning will be limited, making their posts only visible to their followers.</li>
<li>People that have previously posted offensive content on other networks (including Twitter) may be pre-emptively moderated here, though in general we will limit rather than suspend until the accounts actually breach the guidelines on <em>this</em> network.<li>
<li>Servers that fail to meet similar standards of moderation will be limited, though we much prefer to limit individuals if we can.</li>
<li>Servers that encourage offensive content will be blocked.</li>
</ol>

<p>
These principles apply to both local users and federated content, though obviously we can only take the ultimate action to delete content for local users.
</p>

<p>
We will react to reports as quickly as we can, though please remember we are humans and cannot always respond straight away (especially at night). And of course, we can only respond if we know about infringements, so please use the report button!
</p>

<h2>Funding</h2>

<p>

</p>

<h2><a name='conduct'></a>Code of Conduct</h2>

<h3>Our Pledge</h3>

<p>In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, class, or sexual identity and
orientation.</p>

<h3>Our Standards</h3>

<p>Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using welcoming and inclusive language</li>
  <li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</li>
  <li>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</li>
  <li>Focusing on what is best for the community</li>
  <li>Showing empathy towards other community members</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances</li>
  <li>Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks</li>
  <li>Public or private harassment</li>
  <li>Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission</li>
  <li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting</li>
</ul>

<h3>Our Responsibilities</h3>

<p>Server admins are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.</p>

<p>Server admins have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.</p>

<h3>Scope</h3>

<p>This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.</p>

<h3>Enforcement</h3>

<p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the administrator at <a href='https://mastodon.me.uk/@floppy'>@floppy</a>. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.</p>

<p>Server maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.</p>

<h3>Attribution</h3>

<p>This Code of Conduct is adapted from the <a href=""http://contributor-covenant.org"">Contributor Covenant</a>, version 1.4,

<p>We will never share your data with anyone else, except in the case of valid legal requests if it comes to that. (Hopefully it won't come to that!)</p>

<p>Understand though that this instance is run by me and my friends, and (as is the case with all Mastodon servers) we potentially have access to your data, including DMs. The back-end is also not encrypted. If this is not okay with you, this might not be the instance for you.</p>

<p>Also, for truly private data sent between two people, Mastodon offers no E2E encryption. So use Signal or WhatsApp for the things you really want to be private.</p>

<p>More privacy measures on Free Radical:</p>

<li>Our <code>robots.txt</code> file asks crawlers not to explore the site.</li>
<li>HTTPS is used everywhere thanks to <a href=""https://letsencrypt.org/"">Let's Encrypt</a>.</li>

<p>Shelter est une instance Mastodon dédiée aux geeks en tout genre, fans d&#39;animation japonaise, de manga, de jeu vidéo, de technologie, de rétro-gaming, bref, de plein de choses. Les discussions sérieuses de la vraie vie sont aussi les bienvenues.</p>

<h1>Contenu interdit</h1>

<h2>Spam</h2>

<p>La publicité, sous forme répétée et/ou intrusive (faisant mention d&#39;autres utilisateur·ices), n&#39;est pas acceptée. Les comptes concernés seront rendus invisibles aux flux locaux et fédérés, ou supprimés, selon la gravité de la situation.</p>

<h2>Contenu inapproprié</h2>

<p>Sont interdits les propos, images ou vidéos racistes, sexistes, homophobes ou transphobes, la désinformation avec intention de tromper (non parodique quoi), le harcèlement, les propos injurieux et/ou diffamatoires calmonieux, le doxxing, ou le retournement d&#39;une oppression systémique.</p>

<h2>Pédopornographie</h2>

<p>Conformément aux lois françaises et à la jurisprudence, les contenus pédopornographiques, y compris sous forme dessinée, sont illégaux et seront supprimés, et les comptes ou domaines concernés limités (différent d&#39;un blocage) (si distants) ou supprimés (si locaux).</p>

<h2>Contenu sensible sans warning</h2>

<p>La nudité, les contenus érotiques, pornographiques ou visiblement violents doivent être marqués avec le drapeau &quot;sensible / sensitive&quot; par respect pou rles autres utilisateurs. Les comptes ne respectant pas cette règle seront avertis puis supprimés selon la gravité et la répétition de l&#39;infraction.</p>

<h1>Comptes promotionnels</h1>

<p>Les comptes visant à faire la promotion de produits ou de services sont OK tant qu&#39;ils ne spamment pas trop leur contenu et restent dans le thème de l&#39;instance. Si possible, contactez l&#39;administration de l&#39;instance (voir plus bas) avant de créer un compte à cet effet, juste pour éviter que l&#39;on tire à vue. Shelter n&#39;a pas pour vocation à devenir un panneau publicitaire, mais il peut y avoir des exceptions.</p>

<h1>Modération</h1>

<p>L&#39;équipe de modération reçoit et répond à tous vos signalements et vous encourage sincèrement à utiliser cette procédure dès que vous en ressentez le besoin.</p>

<p>Les délais de traitement varient car nous sommes des êtres humains avec une vie à côté mais nous faisons de notre mieux pour faire de cette instance un lieu agréable pour toutes et tous.</p>

<p>Toute instance problématique, qu&#39;elle soit repérée par l&#39;équipe de modération ou signalée, pourra faire l&#39;objet de 2 sanctions : </p>

<ul>
<li><p>La <strong>limitation</strong> : il s&#39;agit d&#39;un blocage partiel au niveau du fil global de Shelter. Vous pouvez toutefois vous abonner aux comptes de cette instance et leur contenu apparaîtra dans votre timeline. Nous appliquons cette sanction lorsque nous considérons que l&#39;intégralité de l&#39;instance n&#39;est pas à exclure.</p></li>
<li><p>La <strong>suspension</strong> : il s&#39;agit d&#39;un blocage total du contenu de cette instance et plus aucune interaction avec elle n&#39;est possible depuis Shelter que ce soit depuis le fil global ou votre timeline.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Dans un souci de transparence, chaque sanction sera motivée par une raison basée sur le règlement de Shelter.</p>

<p><strong>Si vous pensez que nous avons fait une erreur (l&#39;instance a changé de comportement, d&#39;équipe, a appliqué de nouvelles règles de modération, etc.) n&#39;hésitez pas à nous le signaler.</strong></p>

<h1>Respect du Contrat de Serveur Mastodon</h1>

<p>Shelter respecte <a href=""https://joinmastodon.org/fr/covenant"">le Contrat de Serveur Mastodon</a> qui consiste entre autres à s&#39;engager à :</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>I saw a stray fifth symbol! Can you fix it?</em><br>
 Look at our <a href=""https://github.com/rjl20/mastodon/issues"" target=""_blank"">list of bugs</a> on GitHub. If it's known, @rjl20 is probably working on it. If it's not known, add a bug or a PR on GitHub. Tooting at @rjl20 might or might not bring it into his vision as quickly as a GitHub addition.</li>

  <li><em>Can I post links that contain taboo symbols?</em><br>
Go for it. Validation skips links and it's not a faux pas at all.</li>

  <li><em>What if I post symbols that look similar to that taboo glyph?</em><br>
Don't. Mods will discard toots that do this, and if you don't stop, banning may follow.</li> 

  <li><em>No problm I'll writ lik this.</em><br>
No. Stop. Don't do this.</li>

  <li><em>But this is hard?</em><br>
Practicing will bring you far.</li>

  <li><em>What synonym should I sub in for [x]?</em><br>
Try to stop looking for synonyms; if you try to swap out individual words, you'll find it tough going. Pull back and think abstractly about what you want to say and find words for that.</li>

      <li>Posting, and/or sharing an individual's data or information without that individual's approval (informally known as doxing or dropping dox).</li>
      <li>Inciting accounts to post to an individual in additional discussion if that individual has said it should stop (informally known brigading or dogpiling).</li>

<p>All this notwithstanding, administrators of oulipo.social can ban any accounts, at any point, for any motivation, if not in violation of law.</p>

31,58e7f68e8313ad45cf80418b,queer.party,False,6144,"<p><em>queer.party</em> (q.p) is a queer-oriented Mastodon instance which generally aligns itself with the policies and goals of other instances such as <a href=""https://mastodon.social"">mastodon.social</a>, <a href=""https://awoo.space"">awoo.space</a> and <a href=""https://icosahedron.website"">icosahedron.website</a>,
 aiming as much as possible to be a safe space for its users. The rules pretty much boil down to ""be good to each other"", but a few rules I'd like to explicitly list out are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any content or postings which may be illegal under German or Scottish law are not permitted.</li>
<li>Any content or postings containing Nazi symbolism, ideology and the promotion thereof, are strictly forbidden and seriously uncool.</li>
<li>Racism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia and any other discriminatory conduct which attacks any individual or group of individuals based on what they are or what they believe in, is strictly forbidden and also seriously uncool.</li>
<li>Any conduct which abuses this Mastodon instance, or which causes harm to other Mastodon instances, and/or the users thereof, is strictly forbidden and seriously uncool.</li>
<li>While essentially all posts not violating the above are welcome on this instance, you are asked to be considerate and respectful of others - for example, tagging a post about a controversial subject or a commonly-held phobia using content warnings.</li>
<li>Basic parts of your user profile, such as username/display name, profile picture and banner, <em>must not</em> be explicit in nature.</li>
<li>Explicit/NSFW content is allowed, but <em>must</em> be appropriately tagged using the sensitive media and content warning tags.</li>

<p>
<em>This is not Twitter</em>. Reporting posts that make you feel uncomfortable, or that you feel should be brought to our attention, is encouraged. Your reports <em>will not be ignored</em>, and will be dealt with (usually) within a few days. Due to timezone differences or just the fact that I have a full-time job, it may take more than a week. When filing a report, please include information about why you are making the report.<br/>
As this instance, and the fediverse in general, has grown, so too have the moderation demands -- in complex cases, I will reach out to you regarding your report, either to explain the moderation decision taken (if any) or to ask for more information, but for more obvious cases, I unfortunately no longer have the time to notify you as to the status of your report. If your report involves a user or post on another instance, you have the choice of sharing your report with the administration of that instance as well, but the report will always be sent to us.<br/>
No moderation actions are automatic <em>whatsoever</em>. Nothing happens without human review, and I try my utmost to do right by the users on this instance.<br/>
For anything that isn't covered by reporting things in Mastodon, or if you have any questions, concerns or other thoughts, please either direct-message @Maffsie@queer.party, or email the queries address posted above - this goes directly to my inbox.
</p>

<p><em>queer.party is not a company</em>. This Mastodon instance is operated and moderated solely by one person - me (@Maffsie@queer.party). Funding for hosting the service is provided out of my own pocket, and in the past a number of people have given donations via the tip-jar (now closed). I do not ask for or accept funding by any other means, nor do I accept donations when I do not strictly need them.</p>

<p>
<em>queer.party runs on free, open-source software atop human-managed hardware</em>. This means, all software involved in operating queer.party and serving it to the world is open-source and freely licensed. This is, currently, the following:
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon"">Mastodon</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/redis/redis"">Redis</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=summary"">PostgreSQL</a></li>

</ul><br/><br/>
This also means that all hardware involved in operating queer.party directly is leased, paid for and operated by myself. This currently is the following:
<ul>
<li>""the server"" - a Hetzner dedicated server in Falkenstein, Germany, running Alpine Linux, with everything down to the RAID controller being personally configured and managed. Costs approximately forty-eight euro (EUR €48) per month.</li>
<li>""my server"" - a Hetzner dedicated server in Falkenstein, Germany, similarly configured to ""the server"", but primarily used for operating my own personal services, unrelated to queer.party. Hosts a Forgejo instance, which queer.party does use. Costs approximately forty euro (EUR €40) per month.</li>
<li>""homebox"" - a diminuitive little NAS at my home which runs the authentication, authorisation and accounting platform that gates administrative access to queer.party's underlying infrastructure. Purchased in 2016, unknown monthly cost in electricity.</li>
<li>""the boy"" - a Raspberry Pi at my home which runs the Docker cluster management software controlling queer.party's deployment. Purchased in 2020, unknown monthly cost in electricity.</li>
<li>""ebay"" - a Pine64 A64-LTS board at my home which handles securely proxying traffic between my home infrastructure and the Hetzner infrastructure. Purchased in 2018, unknown monthly cost in electricity.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<em>queer.party makes every reasonable effort to avoid third-parties</em>, however this is sometimes unavoidable. The third parties currently involved, and their purposes and limitations, are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Amazon Web Services' Simple Email Service - Used for sending email from queer.party to users, for the purposes of registration confirmation, opted-in notifications, and administrative communications. Not used for receiving email. Use requires providing email address, email subject, and email body to AWS. Unavoidable due to self-hosted email being operationally difficult, and other transactional email providers are more expensive. Costs vary based on user activity but currently average twenty cents (USD $0.20) per month.</li>
<li>Digital Ocean's Domains service - Used for storing and serving the DNS zone for queer.party. Use requires Digital Ocean knowing the IP address of whichever DNS resolution service your computer uses for resolving domains. Unavoidable due to my self-hosted DNS cluster becoming unreliable and caused an outage of queer.party a few years ago and has not been used since. Currently does not have a cost.</li>
<li>Digital Ocean's Spaces service - Used for storing compressed, AES-256-encrypted backups of the Postgres and Redis databases. Backups are fully encrypted before a connection to Digital Ocean is established. Does not transfer any information to Digital Ocean related to queer.party's operations or users. Unavoidable due to having no other infrastructure with the bandwidth and storage needed. Costs approximately five dollars (USD $5) per month.</li>
<li>Backblaze's b2 Object Storage service - Used for storing compressed, AES-256-encrypted backups of user-uploaded media. Backups are fully encrypted before a connection to Backblaze is established. Remote media cached locally, and any user account archives, are explicitly excluded from the backups. Does not transfer any information to Backblaze related to queer.party's operations or users. Unavoidable due to, again, having no other infrastructure able and ready to store these backups at such low a cost. Average cost per month not yet known, but estimated to be around fifty cents (USD $0.50).</li>
<li>Github Repository hosting - Used for fetching source code during the build process for queer.party's software. Unavoidable due to it just being Where The Code People Write Is Usually Stored. Free service.</li>
<li>Docker Hub container image hosting - Used for fetching container images for the services operated for queer.party. Unavoidable due to it just being Where Container Images Are Stored. Free service.</li>
</ul><br/><br/>
<em>queer.party's monthly operational cost is approximately ninety euro (EUR €90)</em>, with an additional yearly cost of approximately twenty two dollars (USD $22) (may be lower due to deals and sales offered by the domain registrar).

<p>
<em>Transparency is important</em>. Where administrative decisions have been made that impacts the userbase of queer.party, those decisions will be detailed on this page.
</p>

<p>
queer.party's federation policy is open-first, however in cases where an instance has been identified as either being indifferent to, permissive of, or as actively encouraging abusive conduct to this or other instances, that instance's domain will be blocked from federation. The block is typically a suspension, such that no interaction between queer.party and the offending instance can take place, however in cases where there is a lesser risk (eg., an instance that is indifferent to abusive conduct but is not known for being a source of abusive conduct), the block is typically a silence block, such that individual users can still interact with each other, but they must be following each other, and posts do not appear in the federated timeline. Such actions are generally only prompted by user reports, except in cases where the administrators of other instances are raising awareness of a new bad actor on the fediverse with reasonable evidence and outside confirmation.
</p>

<p>An addendum to the above is the blanket suspension of federation with instances that claim to forbid abusive or hateful conduct, but which permit ""respectful"" ""discussions"" of ""unpopular opinions""/""controversial views"". Dessert pizza is an unpopular opinion, trans folks' right to live a happy life is not, and hate is hate regardless of how dressed-up it is.</p>

<p>Exceptions to the above are rare, but do happen. Currently, a blanket federation ban is in place for all Gab Social and Soapbox instances, for what should be obvious reasons. Where a specific instance has been blocked, it will be listed below. Due to the use of scraping tools and automated emails requesting to be unblocked, the domains may be partially obscured.</p>

<ol>
<li>As publicações não incluem referências específicas da plataforma, por exemplo, utilizando expressões como ""aqui"", quando isso significa o Twitter, ou incluindo texto literal de outros utilizadores não-Mastodon (por exemplo, tweets com citações de outros tweets).</li>

<h2 id=""privacidade"">Política de Privacidade</h2>

<p>Os dados que publicares no Masto.pt residem num servidor gerido por Hugo Gameiro. Existe um compromisso de não divulgação ou leitura desses dados a não ser em casos de manutenção e moderação da plataforma.</p>

<p>No entanto, este é um servidor federado através do protocolo ActivityPub. Isso significa que outras pessoas em outros servidores federados podem ver a tua informação, mensagens enviadas, etc. Isso também significa que qualquer informação que colocares no Masto.pt, seja ela pública ou privada, pode acabar ""federada"" - basicamente, uma cópia da tua publicação é enviada para qualquer servidor que recebe as tuas publicações. Solicitamos que não coloques no Masto.pt qualquer informação sensível ou que não possa ser tornada pública.</p>

<h4>Quais são os dados que guardamos?</h4>

<ul>
<li><em>Informações básicas da conta:</em> quando te registas neste servidor, será solicitado um nome de utilizador, um endereço de e-mail e uma senha. Também podes inserir outros detalhes de perfil adicionais, como nome público, biografia, e fazer upload de uma imagem de perfil e imagem de cabeçalho. O nome de utilizador, nome público, biografia, foto do perfil e imagem do cabeçalho são sempre listados publicamente.</li>
<li><em>Publicações, seguidores e outras informações públicas:</em> a lista de pessoas que segues e te seguem a ti é listada publicamente, a não ser que optes por tornar essas listas privadas. Quando envias uma mensagem, a data e a hora são armazenadas, assim como a aplicação do qual enviaste a mensagem. As publicações públicas e não listadas estão disponíveis publicamente. As publicações são entregues aos teus seguidores isso significa que podem ser entregues a servidores diferentes e cópias dessa publicação podem ser armazenadas nesses servidores remotos. Quando eliminas uma publicação, é enviado um pedido de eliminação aos servidores com utilizadores que te seguem mas não existe uma certeza que as cópias em servidores remotos sejam eliminadas, por isso pensa bem antes de publicares algo que um dia poderás querer eliminar.</li>
<li><em>Publicações diretas e somente para seguidores:</em> as publicações apenas para seguidores são entregues aos teus seguidores e utilizadores que são mencionados nelas, e as publicações diretas são entregues apenas aos utilizadores mencionados nelas. Nos casos em que esses teus seguidores (ou utilizadores mencionados) sejam remotos, uma cópia é enviada para esses servidores. Fazemos um esforço de boa fé para limitar o acesso a essas publicações apenas a pessoas autorizadas, mas outros servidores podem não fazê-lo. Portanto, é importante ter em atenção os servidores aos quais teus seguidores pertencem. Poderás activar uma opção para aprovar e rejeitar novos seguidores manualmente nas configurações. Lembra-te de que os operadores do servidor e de qualquer servidor remoto podem ver as tuas mensagens e que os destinatários podem capturar imagens, copiar ou partilhar as mesmas de outra forma. Não partilhes nenhuma informação sensível ou que não possa ser tornada pública.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Em que casos podem utilizar os meus dados?</h4>

<p>Os dados que guardamos podem ser usada das seguintes formas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Para providenciar a funcionalidade central do Masto.pt. Só podes interagir com o conteúdo de outras pessoas e publicar o teu próprio conteúdo se tiveres uma conta. Para além disso será necessário uma conta para seguires utilizadores e para podermos agrupar o conteúdo das pessoas que segues.</li>
<li>Para ajudar na moderação da comunidade, por exemplo, comparando o teu endereço IP com outros conhecidos de abusos na comunidade.</li>
<li>O endereço de e-mail fornecido pode ser usado para enviar-te informações, notificações e perguntas relativas à utilização do Masto.pt.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Como protegemos os seus dados?</h4>

<p>Implementamos uma variedade de medidas de segurança para manter a segurança dos teus dados pessoais. Entre outras coisas, a sessão do teu navegador, bem como o tráfego entre as tuas aplicações e a API são protegidos por SSL e a tua senha é criptografada usando um algoritmo unilateral forte.</p>

<h4>Usamos cookies?</h4>

<p>Sim. Cookies são pequenos arquivos que um site ou o seu provedor de serviços transfere para o disco rígido do teu computador por meio do navegador da Web (se o permitires). Os cookies são necessários para entrares na tua conta. Também manteremos cookies para guardar as tuas preferências para visitas futuras.</p>

<h4>Nós revelamos quaisquer dados a terceiros?</h4>

<p>Não vendemos, trocamos ou de outra forma transferimos a terceiros os teus dados de identificação pessoal. Isso não inclui terceiros de confiança que nos ajudam a operar a nossa plataforma, desde que essas partes concordem em manter essas informações confidenciais. Também podemos divulgar os teus dados quando acreditamos que é apropriado para cumprir a lei, fazer cumprir as políticas do nosso site ou proteger os nossos direitos, propriedade ou segurança de outros.</p>

<p>O teu conteúdo público pode ser copiado por outros servidores na rede. As tuas publicações são enviadas aos servidores onde estejam alojados os teus seguidores, com excepção das mensagens diretas que são enviadas apenas aos servidores dos destinatários.</p>

<h4>O site pode ser utilizado por crianças?</h4>

<p>O nosso site é direcionado a pessoas com pelo menos 16 anos de idade. Não utilizes este site se tens menos de 16 anos de idade.</p>

<h4>Posso exportar ou eliminar os meus dados?</h4>

<br/>

<h3 id=""l-welcome"">Welcome !</h3>

<p>This is a Mastodon instance oriented around Retrocomputing and everything that rotates around this theme.<br/>
Of course any other topic is allowed, but you will find probably more retro tech stuff around there!<br/>
We don&#39;t have language restrictions, but please write your reports in english for the admin.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s run by the person you see on the right (that&#39;s me!) and for now, that&#39;s all.<br/>
There might be more admins and moderators later if the needs come but alas not yet. 
<br/>
We run <a href=""https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs/"">Mastodon Glitch Edition</a>.<br/>
<br/></p>

<p>I hope this instance works okay for you, and that you can find a nice and welcoming community here! Feel free to hit me up if you have any questions or requests, be it about this instance, how to make your own instance, or other things not related to Mastodon. 
<br />
<br/>
I am actually the only sysadmin of this instance and I can&#39;t work full-time on oldbytes.space so, I will do whatever I can in a reasonable time to make it works the best it can.</p>

<h3 id=""l-donations"">Donations</h3>

<p>The instance is hosted on a dedicated server (AX41-NVME) by Hetzner (Helsinki), backups are also hosted at Hetzner in the same zone.<br/>
The medias are hosted by Wasabi in eu-central-2 (Frankfurt).<br/>
You can donate to me at <a href=""https://ko-fi.com/dashie_the_otter"" target=""_blank"">https://ko-fi.com/dashie_the_otter</a> for the running costs.<br/>
As of 28/11/2022 I am getting 80€/month.
<br/><br/></p>

<h3 id=""l-rules"">Rules</h3>

<p>This instance has some rules, of course.
<br/>
First, the usual : no sexism, no racism, no hate speech, no LGBTQphobia, no nazis, no spam, no public unflagged porn, no climate change denial, etc... <br/>
Then, I also believe it&#39;s important to remind you that this server was made and is being run by a queer activist.<br/>
This server thrives to be inclusive, and I will ban without much regret.
<br/>
People are encouraged to use the report function as they see fit, and can be confident that their complaints will be heard and dealt with in some way. I want everyone to feel safe here, and if that doesn&#39;t sound like something you like, you should probably find another server. <br/>
No scam content allowed regarding cryptos, and other wallet magic money back things. Links to profiles for donations only are ok, invites are not.<br/><br/></p>

<p>There&#39;s also a pretty important activism aspect of this instance. <br/>
If you&#39;re a marketer, or a #digital #influencer, this is not the place for you. Not only do I feel you should not feel welcome, I intend to make you feel definitely NOT welcome.<br/>
This instance, and this entire social network in my opinion, is dedicated to reclaiming social media, decentralizing, and generally creating better and more engaging communities. <br/>
The three categories of people I mentioned earlier are not, in my opinion, working towards this goal, pretty much the opposite, and they are not welcome on this server.<br/>
Please report them if you see them.<br/>
We also block Nazis, techbros and RMS.<br /><br/><br/></p>

<li> This instance is hosted by Aquilenet, an associative, local and militant ISP in Aquitaine.
It is administered and moderated by volunteers under their own responsibility and not that of the association. </li>
<li> The access is open for everyone, but account creation is subject to approval to limit spam. </li>
<li> The moderation will be strict about cases of bad behaviour on the instance, which includes publishing offensive words or content(sexist, racist, LGBTQI+phobic, ableist, or judged as oppressive in any way) and the cases of cyber-harrassment towards an user. </li>
<li> Confusionist posts are not allowed or tolerated. </li>
<li> Proselytizing in any form is a particularly pernicious form of violence against others and is not tolerated. Whatever your beliefs, convictions or personal choices are, refrain yourself from imposing them on others. </li>
<li> Content causing advertising nuisance will be subject to warning and/or deletion of content and/or account, without notice. </li>
<li> Parody accounts as well as bots must imperatively mention it explicitly in the profile or will be deleted without notice. </li>
<li> Cross posting is extremely badly perceived here, it's prohibited if automated. </li>
<li> Publication here is in French or English (possibly in Spanish), we do not understand other languages and therefore cannot ensure moderation. Please choose an instance that can accommodate you properly. </li>
<li> The use of cw is required for any content that could be perceived as offensive (nudity, pron, violence, blood, classic phobias, etc). If in doubt, it is best to put one on. If anyone asks you to, please remove the offending content and repost it with a cw.</li>

<h1 id=""welcome"">Welcome</h1>

<p>Welcome on the Mastodon instance hosted by the <a href=""https://pirateparty.be"" target=""_blank"">Pirate Party Belgium (PPBe)</a>.</p>

<p>We host this instance so that people who feel they are Pirates can have a nice space for them in the Fediverse. You don't have to agree with everything <a href=""https://pirateparty.be/basic-text"" target=""_blank"">in our basic text</a>, but it will give you a good overview of what a Pirate is and what our values are.</p>

<p>Please <a href=""#code-of-conduct"">read our Code of Conduct</a> before joining us. It might sound harsh, but there are thousands of other instances and you can even host your own.</p>

<p>The instance server is paid with PPBe money and is maintained by the <a href=""https://wiki.pirateparty.be/ITSquad"" target=""_blank"">ITSquad</a>. As for any IT service, the expenses are publicly displayed <a href=""https://wiki.pirateparty.be/ITSquad#Expenses"" target=""_blank"">on our wiki page</a>. The people running this instance are volunteers, so please do take it into account before complaining. Do not hesitate <a href=""https://pirateparty.be/contribute"" target=""_blank"">to contribute</a> if you appreciate what we do!</p>

<p>There will be a lot of politics, free software and rainbows on your timeline if you decide to join us 🌈🌈🌈</p>

<h1 id=""code-of-conduct"">Code of Conduct</h1>

<p><small><i>v1.0, 13th June 2020</i></small></p>

<p><i>If you want to contribute to this Code of Conduct, you can contact the <a href=""/@ppbe"">@ppbe</a> account with what you would like to change. You can also join us at our monthly <a href=""https://wiki.pirateparty.be/Pirate_Lab"" target=""_blank"">Pirate Lab</a>!</i></p>

<p>This Code of Conduct aims to define some <b><a href=""#guidelines"">guidelines</a></b> so that this Mastodon instance stays a pleasant place to be. It's not a rulebook, as things are rarely black &amp; white anyway. We expect you to agree to this Code of Conduct and, with time, to grow trust in the moderation team who has to make it a concrete reality with your help.</p>

<p>First thing to know is that <b>each user has their own moderation tools</b>. If you have an issue with another user (from whatever instance) or with a whole other instance, you can discuss with them, mute them or block them.</p>

<p>It's a good idea to <b>report the problematic behaviour</b> only when you think they disrespect the guidelines below. The moderation team will then consider taking actions against them, and can either discuss, warn, mute or block them to prevent them from interacting with anyone from our instance (see section ""<a href=""#moderation"">How is moderation handled?</a>"").</p>

<p>Changes to this Code of Conduct will be announced on the <a href=""/@ppbe"">@ppbe</a> account. Users who want to discuss about the moderation can send a message to the <a href=""/@ppbe"">@ppbe</a> account. New users on our instance are following that account automatically to be informed.</p>

<h2 id=""guidelines"">Guidelines</h2>

<p>Users from our instance and users who are interacting with us are expected to follow these basic human decency guidelines:</p>

<ol>
  <li>No illegal stuff according to Belgian law</li>
  <li>No spamming, which includes using our instance for referencing</li>
  <li>Be respectful to other people. For example:
    <ol>
      <li>No bully / no harassment</li>
      <li>Respect people's gender / pronouns</li>
      <li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith"" target=""_blank"">Assume good faith</a></li>
      <li>Respect their privacy (no scraping the timelines, don't post private/direct messages public, ...)</li>
      <li>Avoid posting <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_violence"" target=""_blank"">graphic violence</a> and porn in public timelines without content warning.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In addition, by creating an account on our instance, we strongly recommend that you agree with these guidelines specific to our instance:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Bots and community managed accounts are tolerated as long as you don't post on the public timeline (i.e. followers-only or unlisted). If you plan to publish on the public timeline, please contact us first;
    <ol>
      <li>Pirate Party related accounts who wish to publish on the public timelines can also consider checking with <a href=""https://pirateparty.be/pirates-in-the-fediverse/"">one of the other instances run by Pirates</a></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Crossposting from Twitter is tolerated, but we recommend to:
    <ol>
      <li>Avoid crossposting retweets (it's unreadable anyway),</li>
      <li>Use the followers-only mode if you post often on Twitter, so you don't flood the public timeline;</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Use, when possible, an alternative to publishing links to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism"" target=""_blank"">surveillance capitalism</a> websites (like Facebook, Twitter...). Also please try to clean the URL you publish (e.g. don't use URL-shorteners, remove things like ""?fbclid="") so you don't become complicit of surveillance.</li>
</ol>

<p>Being a member of the Pirate Party or contributing to the Pirate Party does NOT absolve you to respect these guidelines.</p>

<h2 id=""moderation"">How is moderation handled?</h2>

<p>First, the moderation team discuss about which action should be taken regarding the problematic account. Usually, they try to contact the person in order to explain what is the problem, and to clarify if needed. Once a consensus is reached within the moderation team, they can decide whether to block or mute the account.</p>

<p>In the case of spamming, harassment, bullying, porn without content warning and, in some case, illegal stuff, a moderator can decide by themself to block or mute the account. However, this action will be reported to the moderation team. A discussion may follow to see if this was the right action to take.</p>

<p>The moderation team can decide to block or mute a whole instance when they feel the community is problematic. For example, they would mute any dedicated porn instance where users don't use content warnings. They would block instances that don't respect users privacy, or that are dedicated to bullying, fascism, etc. If they have solid information about that instance, they might react preventively (e.g. a known fascist community opens an instance).</p>

<p>Whenever an instance is blocked or muted, a public statement is made with the PPBe account. The <a href=""#unavailable-content"">list of moderated instances</a> (blocked or muted) can be consulted at the bottom of this page.</p>

<h3>Who is a moderator and how can I contact them?</h3>

<p>The list of moderators of our instance is made available  : <a href=""https://mastodon.pirateparty.be/@ppbe/104337640135665377"" target=""_blank"">on this pinned toot</a></p>

<h3>What if I don't agree with the decision?</h3>

<p>The moderation team works in good faith and tries to take the best decisions using the current guidelines. If you think we made a mistake, don't hesitate to tell us.</p>

<p>If eventually, you still disagree with the moderation team's decision, please remember that there are <a href=""https://joinmastodon.org/#getting-started"" target=""_blank"">many other available Mastodon instances</a>.</p>

<h3>I want to help!! How can I become a moderator?</h3>

<p>The instance members who wish to become moderator can apply to join the moderation team. This application will be considered by the moderation team.</p>

<p>As there must be a good vibe within the moderation team, it is up to them to decide whether to include a new member or not (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-option"" target=""_blank"">co-optation</a>).</p>

<p>Bienvenue sur l'instance Mastodon du <a href=""https://fr.pirateparty.be"" target=""_blank"">Parti Pirate de Belgique (PPBe)</a>.</p>

<p>Nous hébergeons cette instance afin de permettre aux personnes se définissant comme Pirates d'avoir un espace agréable pour elles sur le Fediverse. Vous ne devez pas être d'accord avec tout ce qui se trouve dans <a href=""https://fr.pirateparty.be/texte-de-base"" target=""_blank""> notre texte de base</a>, mais cela vous donnera un bon aperçu de ce qu'être Pirate signifie et quelles sont nos valeurs.</p>

<p>Veuillez <a href=""#charte"">lire notre Charte</a> avant de nous rejoindre. Cela peut sembler sévère, mais il y a des milliers d'autres instances, et vous pouvez même créer votre propre instance.</p>

<p>Le serveur qui héberge l'instance est payé avec l'argent du PPBe et est géré par l'<a href=""https://wiki.pirateparty.be/ITSquad"" target=""_blank"">ITSquad</a>. Comme pour tous nos services informatiques, les dépenses sont publiées <a href=""https://wiki.pirateparty.be/ITSquad#Expenses"" target=""_blank"">sur notre page wiki</a>. Les personnes qui gèrent cette instance sont toutes bénévoles : merci de bien vouloir prendre cela en compte avant de vous plaindre. N'hésitez pas à <a href=""https://fr.pirateparty.be/contribute"" target=""_blank"">venir nous aider</a> si vous appréciez ce que nous faisons !</p>

<p>Vos flux seront peuplés de politique, logiciels libres, et arcs-en-ciels si vous décidez de nous rejoindre 🌈🌈🌈</p>

<h1 id=""charte"">Charte</h1>

<p><small><i>v1.0, 13 juin 2020</i></small></p>

<p><i>Si vous désirez contribuer à cette Charte, vous pouvez contacter le compte <a href=""/@ppbe"">@ppbe</a> avec vos changements. Vous pouvez également nous rencontrer lors de nos <a href=""https://wiki.pirateparty.be/Pirate_Lab"" target=""_blank"">Pirate Labs</a> mensuels!</i></p>

<p>Cette Charte a pour but de définir quelques <b><a href=""#regles"">règles de bonne conduite</a></b>, ceci afin que cette instance Mastodon reste un endroit agréable. Ce n'est pas un texte de Loi, les choses n'étant jamais simples de toute façon. Nous attendons de vous que vous soyez d'accord avec cette Charte et, avec le temps, que votre confiance grandisse en l'équipe de modération qui a la tâche, avec votre aide, d'en faire une réalité concrète.</p>

<p>La première chose à savoir est que <b>chaque membre de l'instance dispose de ses propres outils de modération</b>. Si vous avez des soucis avec une autre personne (peu importe son instance) ou avec une instance entière, vous pouvez discuter avec elle, la masquer ou la bloquer.</p>

<p>Il est conseillé de ne <b>signaler le comportement problématique</b> d'une personne que si vous pensez qu'elle ne respecte pas les règles ci-dessous. L'équipe de modération envisagera alors les actions à prendre à ce sujet et pourra en discuter avec la personne en question, l'avertir, la masquer ou la bloquer afin de l'empêcher de continuer à interagir avec quiconque sur notre instance (voir aussi la section ""<a href=""#moderation-fr"">Comment la modération est-elle gérée ?</a>"").</p>

<p>Les changements à cette Charte seront annoncés via le compte <a href=""/@ppbe"">@ppbe</a> . Les personnes qui veulent discuter de la modération peuvent envoyer un message au compte <a href=""/@ppbe"">@ppbe</a>. Toute personne qui nous rejoint sur l'instance suit automatiquement ce compte, ceci afin de rester informé·e. </p>

<h2 id=""regles"">Règles de bonne conduite</h2>

<p>Il est attendu des personnes utilisant notre instance et de celles qui interagissent avec nous qu'elles respectent ces règles de bonne conduite permettant de préserver une dignité humaine de base : </p>

<ol>
  <li>Pas de contenu illégal selon le droit belge</li>
  <li>Pas de spam, y compris le fait d'utiliser notre instance pour du référencement</li>
  <li>Soyez respecteux·se envers les autres personnes. Par exemple : 
    <ol>
      <li>Pas d'intimidation/pas de harcèlement</li>
      <li>Respectez le genre/pronoms des autres personnes</li>
      <li><a href=""https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikip%C3%A9dia:Supposer_la_bonne_foi"" target=""_blank"">Supposez la bonne foi</a></li>
      <li>Respectez leur vie privée  (pas d'extraction des données des flux (scraping), pas de publication des messages privés/directs,...)</li>
      <li>Évitez de publier des images de violence explicite et du porno dans les flux publics sans avertissement préalable (content warning)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>De plus, en créant un compte sur notre instance, nous conseillons fortement que vous suiviez les règles suivantes, spécifiques à notre instance :</p>

<ol>
  <li>Les bots et les comptes gérés par un ou des community managers sont tolérés tant que vous ne postez pas dans le flux public (par exemple en ""abonné·es uniquement"" ou ""non listé""). Si vous avez l'intention de publier dans le flux public, prenez contact avec nous au préalable ;</li>
  <li>Le crossposting à partir de Twitter est toléré, mais nous conseillons de :
    <ol>
      <li>Évitez de crossposter des retweets (c'est illisible de toute façon) ;</li>
      <li>Utilisez le mode ""abonné·es uniquement"" si vous postez souvent sur Twitter, ainsi vous ne noierez pas le flux public ;</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Utilisez, si possible, une alternative à la publication de liens vers des sites web du <a href=""https://la-rem.eu/2019/07/capitalisme-de-surveillance/"" target=""_blank"">capitalisme de surveillance</a> (comme Facebook, Twitter...). Essayez aussi de nettoyer les URL que vous publiez (par exemple n'utilisez pas de raccourcisseurs d'URL, supprimez les choses comme ""?fbclid=""), ainsi vous ne devenez pas complices d'une société de surveillance.</li>
</ol>

<p>Être membre du Parti Pirate de Belgique ou contribuer au Parti Pirate ne vous dispense PAS du respect de ces règles de bonne conduite.</p>

<h2 id=""moderation-fr"">Comment la modération est-elle gérée ?</h2>

<p>Tout d'abord, une discussion au sein de l'équipe de modération a lieu pour savoir quelle action devrait être prise au sujet de la personne qui pose problème. En général, l'équipe essaie de contacter la personne afin de lui expliquer le problème et de clarifier la situation si nécessaire. Lorsqu'un consensus est atteint au sein de l'équipe, celle-ci peut décider de bloquer ou masquer le compte.</p>

<p>En cas de spam, d'intimidation, de harcèlement, ou de porno sans avertissement préalable (content warning), et dans certains cas, de contenu illégal, un·e modérateur·ice peut décider seul·e de bloquer ou masquer le compte. Cependant, cette action sera rapportée à l'équipe de modération. Une discussion pourra s'ensuivre afin de savoir si c'était la bonne mesure à prendre.</p>

<p>L'équipe de modération peut décider de bloquer ou masquer une instance entière quand elle estime que la communauté pose problème. Par exemple, l'équipe masquerait une instance dédiée au porno dans laquelle les utilisateurs n'utilisent pas d'avertissement préalable (content warning). L'équipe bloquerait des instances qui ne respectent pas la vie privée des utilisateurs, ou dédiées au harcèlement/à l'intimidation, au fascisme, etc. Si l'équipe a des informations crédibles sur une telle instance, elle peut agir préventivement (par exemple si une communauté fasciste notoire ouvre une instance). </p>

<p>Quand une instance est bloquée ou masquée, une déclaration est faite sur le compte du PPBe. La <a href=""#unavailable-content"">liste des instances modérées</a> (bloquées ou masquées) peut être consultée en bas de cette page.</p>

<h3>Qui fait partie de l'équipe de modération et comment entrer en contact ?</h3>

<p>La liste des modérateurs se trouvent <a href=""https://mastodon.pirateparty.be/@ppbe/104337640135665377"" target=""_blank"">sur ce message épinglé</a></p>

<h3>Et si je ne suis pas d'accord avec la décision ?</h3>

<p>L'équipe de modération fait de son mieux pour prendre ses décisions. Si vous pensez que nous avons fait une erreur, n'hésitez pas à nous le dire.</p>

<p>Si malgré tout, vous n'êtes pas d'accord avec la décision de l'équipe de modération, n'oubliez pas qu'il existe <a href=""https://joinmastodon.org/#getting-started"" target=""_blank"">plein d'autres instances Mastodon</a></p>

<h3>Je veux vous aider !! Comment puis-je faire partie de l'équipe de modération ?</h3>

<p>Les membres de l'instance qui souhaitent rejoindre l'équipe peuvent évidemment poser leur candidature qui sera étudiée par l'équipe de modération.</p>

<p>Il doit y avoir une bonne ambiance entre les différents membres de l'équipe de modération, dès lors la décision d'inclure un nouveau membre revient à l'équipe (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-option"" target=""_blank"">co-optation</a>).</p>

<p><strong>לא חובה להירשם אלינו!</strong> יש עוד הרבה שרתים פתוחים דוברי
עברית אחרים.</p>
<h4 id=""פירוט"">פירוט</h4>
<p>יש כרגע שמונה שרתים דוברי-עברית שפתוחים להצטרפות. הגדול והוותיק מכולם
הוא tooot.im, שמכיל כשני שלישים מכלל דוברי העברית בפדרציה. מכל מיני
סיבות (חברתיות, טכניות, אדמיניסטרטיביות), הפדרציה עובדת טוב יותר עם
שרתים יחסית קטנים וקהילתיים שמפתחים אופי משלהם, ולא כשכולם באותו מקום;
אז כנראה עדיף לכם להצטרף דווקא לאחד השרתים החדשים יותר ולא לתווות.ים.
אבל אתם לגמרי מוזמנים להצטרף לתווות.ים אם זה מה שאתם בוחרים, מכל סיבה
שהיא. בכל מקרה תוכלו לעקוב ולהיעקב בחופשיות אחרי אנשים משרתים אחרים, לא
משנה איפה אתם פותחים את החשבון. וגם, יש אפשרות להעביר מאוחר יותר את
החשבון לשרת אחר, אם תרצו. השרתים העבריים מחוברים ביניהם בממסר כך שתוכן
שמתפרסם בשרת אחד מופיע מיד בפיד הכללי של השרתים האחרים.</p>
<details>
<summary>רשימת <strong>השרתים</strong> (נפתחת בלחיצה)</summary>
<ul>
<li>🍓<a href=""https://tooot.im"">תווות.ים</a>: קיים כשש שנים. הפוקוס שלו
יותר על אינטראקציות חברתיות וכלליות, פחות פוליטיקה; שיחות על פוליטיקה
בפיד הכללי אפשריות עם אזהרת תוכן. השרת מנסה להיות ידידותי לכל קבוצות
האוכלוסייה, וכולל <a

תכנים מטרגרים או טשטוש תמונות מטרגרות.</li>
<li>🍓<a href=""https://hayu.sh/"">היו.ש</a>: השרת הכי ותיק בפידעברי אחרי
תווותים. מריץ תוכנה שנקראת פלרומה, שדומה למסטודון שתווותים מריץ.</li>
<li>🍓<a href=""https://leftodon.social/"">לפטודון.סושיאל</a>: לפטודון הוא
שרת פוליטי בדגש על פוליטיקה שמאלית, סוציאליסטית, פמיניסטית, אנטי גזענית,
ביקורתית ורדיקלית. מקום בשביל לחשוב ביחד, להחליף ידע ורעיונות, ליצור
קשרים ולהתארגן.</li>
<li>🍓<a href=""https://hed.im/"">הד.ים</a>: שרת שקט יחסית (&quot;האינסטנס של
אביה&quot;) שהוקם במטרה לספק נקודת כניסה לפדרציה, לתקשורת פתוחה שלא נשלטת
על-ידי תאגידים. שאיפתו שטרם התממשה היא להיות בית לחוקרים, מדענים, אנשי
חינוך ואקדמיה.</li>
<li>🍓<a href=""https://kishkush.net/"">קשקוש.נט</a>, <a
href=""https://reshet.social/"">רשת.סושיאל</a>: שני שרתים נוספים דוברי
עברית שמתשוקקים למשתמשים חדשים.</li>
<li>🍓<a href=""https://sloth.run"">סלות׳.ראן</a>: שרת בתשלום סמלי שכרגע
מוגדר נסיוני. למי שרוצה להתנסות בשרת פדיברס מסוג קצת אחר בשם Sharkey, עם
קצת יותר פיצ&#39;רים אך גם כמעט ללא מודרציה.</li>

<p>השרת מאוכסן בצרפת והדין החל עליו הוא הדין הצרפתי.</p>
<p>שום תוכן משתמשים על השרת, כולל הודעות ישירות, אינו מאובטח בהצפנה מקצה
לקצה. אנחנו עושים את מירב המאמצים לשמור על המידע מחשיפה לאנשים שלא
מורשים לראותו, כולל חשיפה לאדמינים שלא לצורך, אבל לא מומלץ לפרסם בשרת
מידע שחשיפתו עלולה לגרום נזק ממשי.</p>
<h1 id=""כללים-קהילתיים-מפורטים-יותר"">כללים קהילתיים מפורטים יותר</h1>
<p>אנו שואפים למרחב משותף ומכיל לכלל משתתפיו ללא דיכוי ודורסנות. בקהילה
זו איננו מקבלים:</p>
<ul>
<li>הטרדה</li>
<li>התקפות אישיות</li>
<li>הערות תוקפניות או משפילות</li>
<li>צורות אחרות של דיכוי ופגיעה בקבוצות מוחלשות</li>
</ul>
<p>בעלי השרת ומנהלי הקהילה הם הגורם הסופי המחליט מהי פרשנות נכונה של
הכללים.</p>
<h2 id=""דוגמאות-להתנהלות-נפוצה-שיכולה-להחשב-כהטרדה"">דוגמאות להתנהלות
נפוצה שיכולה להחשב כהטרדה:</h2>
<ul>
<li>המשך אינטראקציה עם משתמש.ת שביקש.ה באופן ברור להפסיק את האינטראקציה
הזו, או עידוד משתמשים אחרים לעשות זאת</li>
<li>איסוף או הפצה של נתונים פרטיים של אדם ללא רשותו המוצהרת (פרקטיקה
המכונה לעתים doxing)</li>
<li>יצירה ושיתוף של צילומי מסך של הודעות לעוקבים בלבד או הודעות
פרטיות</li>
<li>אינטראקציה עם אופי מיני עם אדם שלא הביע עניין בכך או שלא הייתה עמו
מספיק אינטראקציה קודמת על מנת לבסס עניין בכך</li>
<li>שיתוף תמונות עירום ללא אזהרת תוכן</li>
</ul>
<p>עם זאת, לא נוכל להתערב במקרה של סכסוך, חוסר התאמה או חוסר תקשורת
אישיים שאין בהם עניין קהילתי. במקרים כאלה, אתם מוזמנים תמיד להשתמש
בההשתקה או בחסימה מול כל אדם שתבחרו, מכל סיבה או ללא סיבה, וכן לבחור
ברמות הפרטיות המתאימות לחשבון ולפוסטים שלכם כדי ליצור לעצמכם סביבה מוגנת
ונעימה. וכמובן, אתם מוזמנים תמיד להמשיך ולדווח אם אתם מרגישים שבתגובה או
פוסט כלשהם יש גם בעיה קהילתית, או שהם חורגים מגבולות הסכסוך האישי
גרידא.</p>
<h3 id=""תכנים-אסורים"">תכנים אסורים</h3>
<p>תוכן מהסוגים הבאים יוסר בלי אזהרה, וצפוי להוביל לחסימת הגישה שלך
לשירות:</p>
<ul>
<li>הצגה מינית של ילדים.ות</li>
<li>תוכן שעובר על הדין החל על מאחסן השרת[1], כולל הכחשת שואת היהודים
והצגת סמלים נאציים</li>
<li>כל תוכן המקדם אידיאולוגיה גזענית ו/או לאומנות אלימה, בכלל זה הסתה
לרצח עם, נאציזם או כהניזם</li>
<li>איומים באלימות או קריאה לאלימות</li>
<li>סקסיזם או תמיכה בסקסיזם</li>
<li>להט״בופוביה או תמיכה בלהט״בופוביה (כולל ביפוביה, טרנספוביה
ואנביפוביה)</li>
<li>שנאת זרים ו/או מהגרים</li>
<li>אייבליזם (יכולתנות) או תמיכה באייבליזם</li>
<li>לעג לקהילות שוליים אחרות</li>
<li>התנגדות לחיסונים והכחשה של תיאוריית האבולוציה באמצעות ברירה טבעית
ושל משבר האקלים מעשה ידי אדם, וכן הפצת תיאוריות קונספירציה בנושאים
אלו</li>
<li>שנאה או עידוד שנאה כלפי זהויות אמוניות ולא-אמוניות דתיות
ורוחניות</li>
</ul>
<p>חשבונות שמשמשים באופן קבוע להפיץ תוכן מהסוגים הנ&quot;ל, גם אם לא באופן
פומבי לחלוטין, ייחסמו לצמיתות.</p>
<p><strong>כל משתמשי.ות השרת מקבלות על עצמן, בעת הרישום ולאורך כל תקופת
החברות בשרת, לשאוף לקיים כללים אלו</strong> ולפעול נגד תכנים והתנהלות
שעוברים עליהם. בפרט אנו מעודדים את כל המשתמשים.ות לדווח על תוכן שמפריע
להן כדי להביאו לתשומת לב מנהלי השרת.</p>
<h2 id=""תכנים-רגישים"">תכנים רגישים</h2>
<p>על מנת ליצור מרחב מכיל המתאים לכלל משתתפי הקהילה, יש סוגי תוכן אותם
אנחנו שואפים לא להציג באופן גלוי לכל, אלא להשתמש בכלים להסתרת תוכן ( א”ת
= לחצן אזהרת תוכן=CW לטקסט, Sensitive לתמונות) להסתרתם מעיניים של מי
שמעדיפה לא לראותם.</p>
<p>שימו לב שגם לא נציג תוכן כזה לעיני כל בתמונת הפרופיל או בתיאור האישי
בפרופיל שלנו.</p>
<p>מי שאינו מעוניין שתכנים אלו יוסתרו מעיניו, ניתן לבטל את הסתרות התוכן
בממשק האישי שלכם על ידי גישה לקישור הבא: <a
href=""https://tooot.im/settings/preferences/appearance""
class=""uri"">https://tooot.im/settings/preferences/appearance</a> וסימון
&quot;always expand posts marked with content warning”. באותו האופן ניתן גם
לבטל בממשק האישי הסתרה של תמונות.</p>
<p>שימו לב שניתן בקלות להסתיר הודעות שסומנו בתגיות (האשטג-ים) שמפריעות
ע”י הגדרה של מסננים מתאימים.</p>
<p>אנו מעודדים שימוש ליברלי באזהרות תוכן על מנת להפוך את המרחב לנגיש
יותר ונעים לכל המשתמשים והמשתמשות. משתמשות.י השרת מתבקשים להיות קשובים
לסביבתם ולהתחשב בה, ולסמן באזהרת תוכן נושאים אשר נתבקשתם ממספר משתמשים
לסמנם, או תכנים שאתן סבורות שסימונם ישפר את חוויית השימוש של הקהילה.</p>
<p>מטבע הדברים תיתכנה פרשנויות רבות למה בדיוק מהווה תוכן רגיש, נעים או
לא מקובל, ולא ייתכן שיפוט אובייקטיבי לגמרי בעניין זה. כלל האצבע שלנו הוא
הכלה בצד שיקול דעת: התחשבו בחברי הקהילה שלכם, ונסו להבין גם את הצד
המפרסם.</p>
<p>שימו לב להבדל בין פוסט ברמת פרטיות “פומבי” לבין “לא רשום” לבין
“לעוקבים בלבד”.</p>
<p>🌏 פוסט פומבי (מסומן בגלובוס) יהיה זמין גם לכל מי שיהודהד אליו
בפדרציה כולה, ובנוסף גם לפיד המקומי של כל השרת. הפוסט יפורסם לכולם, וכך
יזכה לחשיפה רחבה יותר, לטוב ולרע.</p>
<p>🔓 פוסט לא רשום (מסומן במנעול פתוח) יישלח לעוקביכם, אך גם כל האנשים
בשרת ומחוצה לו יכולים לראות אותו, במידה ויגיעו אליו (למשל דרך הדהוד שלו
ע”י אחד מעוקביכם).</p>
<p>🔒 פוסט לעוקבים בלבד יהיה זמין לעוקביכם בלבד.</p>
<p>לכן, הפרשנות של מה מהווה תוכן רגיש, לא נעים או לא מקובל, ומה אזהרות
התוכן הדרושות, תתייחס גם להקשר של רמת הפרטיות. אנא חישבו לפני פרסום כל
פוסט מהי רמת הפרטיות המתאימה לו. ברירת המחדל של פרסום היא “פומבי” אבל
ניתן לשנותה.</p>
<h3 id=""תכנים-שיש-להזהיר-מפניהם"">תכנים שיש להזהיר מפניהם</h3>
<p>באמצעות הסתרה תחת א”ת או מדיה כרגישה בפרסומים פומביים (כולל unlisted)
כוללים:</p>
<p>❌ ברמת הפרטיות הזו, <strong>יש להגדיר תוכן כזה כרגיש</strong> אם הוא
גרפי, ולהסתירו תחת אזהרת תוכן אם הוא טקסטואלי.</p>
<p>✅ ברמת הפרטיות הזו, <strong>אין חובה</strong> להגדיר תוכן כזה כרגיש

<li>בוטים המפרסמים בתדירות גבוהה חייבים לפרסם בהגדרת פרטיות המונעת את

<p>サークル「<a href=""https://akane.blue/"">秘密結社あかねぶるー</a>」によって 2017/04/12 から運用されている、日本語を主とした汎用 Mastodon サーバーです。</p>

<p>現在は <strong>""あなたの「すき」をもっと自由に書き表すための場所。""</strong> をモットーに運用しています。</p>

<p>ローカルタイムラインを見る限りは、日常の何気ないつぶやきから、コンピューターやモバイル端末、オープンソースソフトウェア、音楽ゲームやPCゲーム(VRを含む)、はたまた対象年齢の定められているゲームや音声作品などについての投稿が盛んであると言えるかもしれません。</p>

<p>しかしながら、公開タイムラインはこの世界の全てでは<b>ありません</b>。あなたがこのサーバーを信頼してルールに従う範囲において、誰をフォローして何をトゥートするかは各種タイムラインに縛られることはなく、あなたの自由です。</p>

<h2><span class=""fa fa-server fa-fw"" aria-hidden=""true""></span> サーバー構成</h2>

<h2><span class=""fa fa-life-ring fa-fw"" aria-hidden=""true""></span> Q&A</h2>

<h3>Q. よくこのサーバーを指して言われる <b>末代</b> って結局何なんですか？</h3>

<p>A. ネタとしてよく言われる「末代まで呪ってやる…！」『<b>俺が末代だ！</b>』ってやつと概ね同義です。まあこれは誤用だとかそうでないとかいろいろあるけど、改めて説明すると<b>「美少女コンテンツにのめり込みすぎた結果、その生涯を未婚のまま終える見込みであり、自分の代で家系が途絶える自覚を持っていること。また、その自嘲」</b>みたいな感じです。そういう人が設立したので通称としてそう呼ばれていますが、そうでない人も歓迎しています。実際既婚者も子持ちも全然居ます。</p>

<p>ちなみに、よくサーバー紹介で書かれている「末代というコミュニティが元になって～」という記載は <b>誤り</b> です。先に書いた通りそういう人が立てたのが先、そういう人たちが集まったことによるコミュニティが後。</p>

<h3>Q. 公開タイムラインを見る限り、時間帯を問わず職場不適切な内容の発言が跋扈していませんか？</h3>

<p>A. 基本的には自衛としてのブロックやミュートをお願いしています。</p>

<p>しかしながら、性的嗜好の話というものは大変に幅が広く、従来のキーワードミュートでは到底対処しきれるものではありませんでした。あらゆる性的嗜好の話題から身を守るために、あらゆる性的嗜好のキーワードに触れる必要があるのは本末転倒ですからね。</p>

<p>そこで私たちは、統一された、しかし元々意味を持たない単語を添えて投稿してもらうことで、ミュートを容易に行えるのではないかと考えました。これなら既存の仕組みでカバーでき、インスタンス自体への改造もあまり必要としないため、様々なサードパーティクライアントでも利用可能です。</p>

<p>現在、ユーザの皆さんにはそういった自覚のある投稿には <a href=""https://wiki.maud.io/mastodon/slangs#%E3%81%9D%E3%81%8E%E3%81%8E"">そぎぎ</a> を付与するよう推奨しているので、「設定」→「フィルター」から単語ミュートの対象に「そぎぎ」を追加することである程度防げるようになるかと思います。</p>

<h2>Etiquette pointers</h2>

<p>Many on the fediverse are trying to make social media kinder, more personal, and more accessible. Here are some things you can do to help.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use content warnings liberally.</p>

<p>Commonly tagged subjects include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Common phobias, and triggers (spiders, blood, gross stuff, trauma, etc)</li>
<li>Politics (often: &ldquo;pol&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Hot takes (opinions delivered <em>on the spot</em> with little thought, often worded in a provocative and generalising manner)</li>
<li>Selfies</li>
<li>Public displays of affection, affectionate subtoots (often: &ldquo;pda&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Food</li>
<li>Money</li>
<li>Family</li>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Mental health in particular (often: &ldquo;mh&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Negativity</li>
<li>Negativity about oneself in particular (often: &ldquo;self neg&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, when a lot of people are talking about one subject, it&rsquo;s polite to tag that subject, using the CW as a <em>subject field</em> of sorts. It is also polite to tag long posts and threads similarly.</p>

<p>Content warnings are invaluable in letting people decide if and when to deal with subjects that may be harmful or exhausting to them.</p>

<p>It is helpful to augment a CW, indicating if it is positive (+), negative (-), a joke, a shitpost, etc. More context is always better.</p></li>
<li><p>Strive for accessibility</p>

<p>You can add a caption to images or videos you upload. This helps people with sight impairments get the context of your post. Writing a good, concise caption is an art but any caption is better than none!</p>

<p>Another practice that helps is spelling hashtags composed of several words #LikeThis with capital letters, as opposed to #likethis. This helps screen-reader software read them correctly.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also polite to CW posts that won&rsquo;t make any sense to screen-readers at all, like ASCII art or posts spelling out things in
<span title=""emoji"" aria-label='emoji'>💶Ⓜ️🅾️🌶️❗</span></p></li>
<li><p>Avoid using a crossposter.</p>

<p>These programs or services broadcast your posts from one network to another and back, usually between Twitter and a fediverse server like Chitter. They are controversial across the fediverse. A common criticism is that it feels like the person is &ldquo;not really there,&rdquo; reacting to things happening on another network entirely, and broadcasting Twitter culture, which many have come to the fediverse to avoid.</p>

<p>If you want to use one despite this, it is polite to set it not to post remote posts as public, and even to set a CW on them indicating where the posts originated.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>It is up to each one of us whether we want to follow these guidelines, but administrative action may be taken against members behaving counter to them to the point of disturbing others, and continuing to do so after being asked to change their behaviour.</p>

<h4>1. 法律は守ってください</h4>

<p>犯罪に加担していそうだったり、日本法に抵触するようなトゥートは禁止です。最悪警察や裁判所の要請に応じてログを開示することになります。</p>

<h4>2. CWやNSFWはちゃんと使ってください</h4>

<p>
  誰かが不快になりそうだと思った文章を投稿したい時にはContent Warning(CW)を、画像にはNot Safe For Work(NSFW)タグを付けてください。警告文には、見たくない人が投稿の内容を表示しないでスルーできるような説明を書いてください(例: エロ, グロ, 長文, Undertaleネタバレ)。たとえ付けていても日本法に抵触するような画像を投稿する行為は禁止です。<br>
  とはいえ、正直なところ1人でも傷つく可能性がある投稿には全てCWを付けろと言ってもキリが無くなってしまいます。特にローカルTLや連合TLはたくさんの人の発言がほぼフィルタリングされずに流れてくるタイムラインです。それらのタイムラインを覗くときには不愉快な投稿が目に見えてしまう可能性があると言うことをある程度割り切ってください。
</p>

<h4>3. 他人に迷惑をかけたり、不快にするような行為は禁止です</h4>

<p>連投やフォロ爆などの過度に迷惑がかかる投稿は禁止です。スパムにしか見えないような宣伝とかもやめてね。</p>

<h4>4. みんな仲良く</h4>

<p>
  ブロックとかミュートとかあるからね、絶対に仲良くできなさそうな人がいたら突っかかる前に距離を取ろうね。ブロックしました報告とかもトラブルの元になるだけだからやめようね。<br>
  人に自分ルールを押し付けて不快にさせる行為も禁止です。あなたのルールはここのルールではありません。ネタだとしても不快にさせる時点でよくありません。
</p>

<p><hr style=""margin: 2em 0;""></p>

<h3>Bot運用ルール</h3>

<p>
  ある程度プログラムが書ける人の中には、API経由で投稿ができるWebサービスを見つけたら何かボットを作ってみたくなる人も多いことかと思いますが、そういった方々にお願いがあります。
</p>

<p>
  Mastodonの根幹となる要素に「連合」というものがあります。これは、リモートフォローをすることによって他のインスタンスのアカウントとも繋がることが出来るという、従来主流であったSNSには存在しなかった要素です。
</p>

<p>
  Mastodonには連合の仕組みがあり、他のインスタンスからリモートフォローを受けることができるため、何百、何千とあるインスタンスのうち、いずれか一つのインスタンスにBotアカウントを設置していれば、使いたい人はそれをリモートフォローしに行くことができます。
</p>

<p>
  ですから、わざわざ他のインスタンスにも設置したBotをわざわざmstdn.jpにも設置するようなことは絶対にしないでください。そのようなBotに対してはサイレンス処理を行うことがあります。
</p>

<p>
  また、ローカルタイムラインや連合タイムラインは、日常的に閲覧する用途に向いていないタイムラインではありますが、交流したい人を探す用途に用いられていることは確かですので、なるべく自動投稿の類が表示されることを避けたいと思っています。そこでmstdn.jpにBotを設置しようと考えている方々には、最低限以下の条件を守って頂きたいと思います:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Publicな投稿をしないこと(Unlisted, Private, Directを使ってください)</li>
  <li>能動的に他のアカウントをフォローしに行かないこと</li>
  <li>フォローしていない人のトゥートを自動でお気に入り登録したり、リプライを飛ばしたりしないこと</li>
</ul>

<p>
  意図としては、Twitterの<a href=""https://help.twitter.com/ja/rules-and-policies/twitter-automation"">自動化ルール</a>と同じような感じです。許可なくスパムのような挙動をしていると判断したbotはサイレンス、アカウント停止などの措置を取らせて頂きます。

<h3>ルール</h3> 

<p> 

  違反者には、アカウントの停止等の措置を取らせていただく場合がございます。<br> 

  措置に不服がある場合には、メールにてお問い合わせください。 

</p>

  <li style=""margin: 0;"">他人に迷惑をかけたり、不快にするような行為は禁止です</li> 

  <li style=""margin: 0;"">みんな仲良く</li> 

</ol> 

<h4>1. 法律は守ってください</h4> 

<p>犯罪に加担していそうだったり、日本法に抵触するようなトゥートは禁止です。最悪警察や裁判所の要請に応じてログを開示することになります。</p> 

<h4>2. CWやNSFWはちゃんと使ってください</h4> 

<p> 

  誰かが不快になりそうだと思った文章を投稿したい時にはContent Warning(CW)を、画像にはNot Safe For Work(NSFW)タグを付けてください。警告文には、見たくない人が投稿の内容を表示しないでスルーできるような説明を書いてください(例: エロ, グロ, 長文, Undertaleネタバレ)。たとえ付けていても日本法に抵触するような画像を投稿する行為は禁止です。<br> 

  とはいえ、正直なところ1人でも傷つく可能性がある投稿には全てCWを付けろと言ってもキリが無くなってしまいます。特にローカルTLや連合TLはたくさんの人の発言がほぼフィルタリングされずに流れてくるタイムラインです。それらのタイムラインを覗くときには不愉快な投稿が目に見えてしまう可能性があると言うことをある程度割り切ってください。 

</p> 

<h4>3. 他人に迷惑をかけたり、不快にするような行為は禁止です</h4> 

<p>連投やフォロ爆などの過度に迷惑がかかる投稿は禁止です。スパムにしか見えないような宣伝とかもやめてね。</p> 

<h4>4. みんな仲良く</h4> 

<p> 

  ブロックとかミュートとかあるからね、絶対に仲良くできなさそうな人がいたら突っかかる前に距離を取ろうね。ブロックしました報告とかもトラブルの元になるだけだからやめようね。<br> 

  人に自分ルールを押し付けて不快にさせる行為も禁止です。あなたのルールはここのルールではありません。ネタだとしても不快にさせる時点でよくありません。 

</p> 

<p><hr style=""margin: 2em 0;""> </p>

<h3>Bot運用ルール</h3> 

<p> 

  ある程度プログラムが書ける人の中には、API経由で投稿ができるWebサービスを見つけたら何かボットを作ってみたくなる人も多いことかと思いますが、そういった方々にお願いがあります。 

</p> 

<p> 

  Mastodonの根幹となる要素に「連合」というものがあります。これは、リモートフォローをすることによって他のインスタンスのアカウントとも繋がることが出来るという、従来主流であったSNSには存在しなかった要素です。 

</p> 

<p> 

  Mastodonには連合の仕組みがあり、他のインスタンスからリモートフォローを受けることができるため、何百、何千とあるインスタンスのうち、いずれか一つのインスタンスにBotアカウントを設置していれば、使いたい人はそれをリモートフォローしに行くことができます。 

</p> 

<p> 

  ですから、わざわざ他のインスタンスにも設置したBotをわざわざ Pawooにも設置するようなことは絶対にしないでください。そのようなBotに対してはサイレンス処理を行うことがあります。 

</p> 

<p> 

  また、ローカルタイムラインや連合タイムラインは、日常的に閲覧する用途に向いていないタイムラインではありますが、交流したい人を探す用途に用いられていることは確かですので、なるべく自動投稿の類が表示されることを避けたいと思っています。そこで Pawoo にBotを設置しようと考えている方々には、最低限以下の条件を守って頂きたいと思います: 

</p> 

<ul> 

  <li>Publicな投稿をしないこと(Unlisted, Private, Directを使ってください)</li> 

  <li>能動的に他のアカウントをフォローしに行かないこと</li> 

  <li>フォローしていない人のトゥートを自動でお気に入り登録したり、リプライを飛ばしたりしないこと</li> 

</ul> 

<p> 

  意図としては、Twitterの<a href=""https://help.twitter.com/ja/rules-and-policies/twitter-automation"">自動化ルール</a>と同じような感じです。許可なくスパムのような挙動をしていると判断したbotはサイレンス、アカウント停止などの措置を取らせて頂きます。 

</p>

<h3><a name=""general""></a>General Notice</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>The following is not allowed on •ART: Unapproved bots, username squatting, registrations of famous trademarks/names (unless proof of identity is given).</strong> To be certain that your account isn't removed due to inactivity, be sure to upload an avatar and post at least once. Accounts without avatars or any activity may be deleted to free up registration space on the instance.</li>

  <li><strong>Do not use •ART as a permanent back up or repository for your information, statuses, or media.</strong> Please keep an original copy of your work on your local machine, as Mastodon downsizes large file sizes. We cannot guarantee perpetual storage of your toots, information, or media on our servers. Please make a periodic local backup of your account to safeguard against possible data loss.</li>

  <li><strong>You may move your account to another instance at any time by using the ""Move to a different account"" setting at the bottom of your Edit Profile page in your Preferences.</strong> You can also export your follow and block lists from the Import & Export page and import them into your new account to make the transition easier.</li>

  <li><strong>You may delete your account at any time using the ""Delete account"" option at the bottom of the Edit Profile page.</strong> Keep in mind that federation of your statuses to other servers or search engines is beyond •ART's control — statuses, media and federated copies of your profile may remain elsewhere. Deleting your account is permanent, cannot be undone, and your username/content cannot be reinstated.</li>

  <li><strong>We block or suspend many instances that do not adhere to •ART's ToS and CoC.</strong> Also, instances are intermittently and temporarily silenced during report investigations or when other instance moderators are not monitoring their users for any of the behaviours against our ToS/CoC.</li>

  <li><strong>Please support the community</strong> by regularly boosting and positively interacting with other members.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Mastodon.ART has a <a href=https://liberapay.com/curator>LiberaPay Account</a>, a <a href=""https://ko-fi.com/mastoart"">Ko-Fi</a> and a <a href=https://patreon.com/MastodonArt>Patreon</a></strong> if you'd like to support the operation and maintenance of our artistic community.</li>

</ol>

<h3><a name=""coc""></a>Code of Conduct</h3>

<p><p>The following guidelines are not a legal document, and final interpretation is up to the administration of Mastodon.ART. These guidelines are here to provide you with an insight into the site and moderation policies because all members are guests here.</p></p>

<p>See our <a href=""https://dotart.blog/dotart-blog/cultural-appropriation-policy"">Cultural Appropriation Policy</a> for handling reports of cultural appropriation in creative works on .art.</p>
  

<p><ol></p>

<p><li>All users, local and remote, are expected to adhere to the following principles:</p>

<p><ol type=""a""></p>

<p><li>If you post someone else&#39;s work, you must credit the original artist/author, and must include some form of analysis or opinion on the work posted.</li></p>

<p><li>Posting the same or similar content on multiple different instances (Fediverse servers) in order to spam local and/or federated timelines is not permitted.</li></p>

<p><li>Respect other users&#39; boundaries. Be respectful and sincerely apologize if someone informs you that a boundary has been crossed. Give people space if you accidentally push past a boundary.</li></p>

<p><li>If you find yourself involved in a conflict and are worried about the situation escalating, contact @Curator or any of the mods listed above.</li></p>

<p><li>Tag sensitive content such as violence/blood, graphic nudity, lewd content, and other potentially upsetting or triggering topics and hide them under a Content Warning (CW). CWs are a big part of the culture of the Fediverse, and CWing potentially upsetting content is how we keep our community and the wider Fediverse safe and supportive for everyone. (We also recommend people CW political posts, but we will not mandate it.)</li></p>

<p></ol></p>

<p></li></p>

<p><li>All users, local and remote, will be considered in the wrong if they participate in the following:</p>

<p><ol type=""a""></p>

<p><li>Microaggressions (&quot;not all men&quot;, white/man/cis-splaining etc.), ableism, deliberate mis-gendering</li></p>

<p><li>Demanding education on problematic behaviour from a non-admin/moderator</li></p>

<p><li>Skirting the lines of being a troll, or directly trolling</li></p>

<p><li>Sharing DM screenshots or quotes from DMs or private communications publicly without all parties&#39; permission</li></p>

<p><li>Creating memes about someone without their permission</li></p>

<p><li>Ranting or engaging in long rambling tangents on public timelines about a particular user without explicitly naming them (also known as &quot;subtooting&quot;)</li></p>

<p><li>Not tagging potentially sensitive or triggering toots</li></p>

<p></ol></p>

<p>This is not an exhaustive list, and all moderation decisions are ultimately left up to the discretion of our mod team.  If any of these don&#39;t make sense, please speak with anyone on the mod team. We are more than happy to help you understand the problems with these kinds of behaviours.</p>

<p></li></p>

<p><li>The following types of content will be removed from the public timeline:</p>

<p><ol type=""a""></p>

<p><li>Corporate advertising and spam (does not include sharing links to your art-related income sites! You are allowed and encouraged to share your shop links, commissions info, donation sites, etc.)</li></p>

<p><li>Unapproved news bots, post bots or follow bots</li></p>

<p><li>Untagged/non-content-warned sensitive content (violence, gore, sexually explicit, etc.)</li></p>

<p></ol></p>

<p></li></p>

<p><li>The following types of content will be removed from the public timeline, and may result in account suspension and revocation of access to the service (please also note that .art does not allow those known for harassing marginalised people off-platform to have an account on .art):</p>

<p><ol type=""a""></p>

<p><li>Racism, sexism, or advocation thereof</p>

<p><li>Discrimination against gender and sexual minorities, or advocation thereof</li></p>

<p><li>Ableism; discrimination against those who are neurodivergent, physically disabled, or mentally ill; fatmisia</li></p>

<p><li>Xenophobia and/or violent nationalism, or advocation thereof</li></p>

<p></ol></p>

<p></li></p>

<p><li>The following types of content are explicitly disallowed and will result in revocation of access to the service:</p>

<p><ol type=""a""></p>

<p><li>Sexual depictions of minors, real or fictional</li></p>

<p><li>Content illegal in Germany and/or France, such as holocaust denial or Nazi symbolism</li></p>

<p><li>Conduct promoting the ideology of National Socialism</li></p>

<p></ol></p>

<p></li></p>

<p><li>•ART has a zero-tolerance mandate for harassment or bullying — your account will be immediately suspended.</li></p>

<p><li>Any conduct intended to stalk or harass other users, impede other users from using the service, degrade the performance of the service, or incite others to perform any of the aforementioned actions, is also disallowed and subject to punishment up to and including revocation of access to the service. This includes, but is not limited to, the following behaviors:</p>

<p><ol type=""a""></p>

<p><li>Continuing to engage in conversation with a user that has specifically requested for said engagement with that user to cease and desist may be considered harassment, regardless of platform-specific privacy tools employed.</li></p>

<p><li>Aggregating, posting, and/or disseminating a person&#39;s demographic, personal, or private data without express permission (informally called &quot;doxing&quot;) will be considered harassment.</li></p>

<p><li>Inciting users to engage another user in continued interaction or discussion after a user has requested for said engagement with that user to cease and desist (informally called &quot;brigading&quot; or &quot;dogpiling&quot;) may be considered harassment.</li></p>

<p></ol></p>

<p></li></p>

<p><li>Please do not flood the local timeline. We define &quot;flooding&quot; as posting mutliple posts in quick succession to the local/public timeline (but the definition is flexible; judgements on flooding will be made in context). Flooding drowns out other users and annoys instances we federate with. 
    <ul><li>You can reply to the toots of others and banter back and forth as much as you want, as replies aren&#39;t shown on the local/public timelines.</li>
    <li>Please avoid posting many pieces of art/media all at once. Sticking to one post per ten minutes (with one-four pictures attached) is a good baseline to follow. Please respect others&#39; content and statuses so that they can discover other artists in the local timeline.
    <li>If you&#39;d like to post long threads of many toots, consider marking the first toot as &quot;public&quot;, and the rest in replies marked as &quot;unlisted&quot;. This will allow users to click through the first toot to read the rest of the thread without flooding the local/public timelines.</li></ul>
   </li></p>

<p><li><strong>Regarding nudity/lewd/explicit content:</strong> <br>
 <p>  It&#39;s considered good form to put nudity behind a CW as a courtesy for other users in the fediverse at large, and we encourage this practice. Recognizing the subjectivity of the matter, we consider this a recommendation rather than a hard rule where <em>very light</em> nudity with no genitalia showing is concerned, and we will approach any reports or complaints on a case-by-case basis.</p>
     <ul><li>Illustrative nudity and body/anatomy studies with very visible genitalia, and titillating / erotic imagery intended for mature audiences,  are allowed on •ART, but <strong>only</strong> if tagged appropriately (ex. #lewd, #nudity, etc.) and marked as sensitive or placed under a descriptive content warning.
       <ul><li>Tags are required so people have the opportunity to filter such content from their timelines altogether.</li>
       <li>Descriptive text is required so that people can make an informed decision about whether to engage with the content behind the CW/image blur.</li>
        <li>If you&#39;re unsure whether to mark a work as sensitive or post it under a Content Warning, consider the following hypothetical questions: Is it something you&#39;d be comfortable viewing in a white collar work situation? Is it something you&#39;d be comfortable being viewed by a minor? Would you happily show it to your parents? A no to any of these questions may require it being CWed/marked as sensitive. If you&#39;re still unsure, marking it as sensitive/CWing it is a good bet.
        <li>Another way to decide whether to mark a work as sensitive or post it under a Content Warning is to remember the <strong>Three B&#39;s</strong>: If your work features any <strong>B</strong>oobs, <strong>B</strong>utts, or <strong>B</strong>its (genitals), hide that sucker!</li>
       </ul>
       </li>
     <li>Loli or sexual content with characters of questionable age, as well as &#39;ageing up&#39; characters from fandoms that are minors in order to depict them in sexual situations, is expressly prohibited — your account will be suspended. (This includes cub porn.) 
       </li>
      <li>Nude photographs are only allowed if done in an artistic spirit — however, it still needs to be tagged and CWed/marked as sensitive. Erotic photography, pornography, or photography that puts too much emphasis on the genitals is <strong>not allowed</strong>, even if marked &quot;Unlisted&quot;/&quot;Followers Only&quot;.</li>
      <li>We understand that these things are subjective, but final interpretation of these rules are up to our moderation team.</li></ul></p>

<p><li>Gore, vore, and blood violence must also be placed under a descriptive content warning or marked sensitive.</li></p>

<p><li> No NFT content. No advertising NFTs, no selling NFTs, no linking to off-platform NFTs or NFT content, no images connected to NFTs.</li></p>

<p><li> AI-generated imagery (images generated by a neural network that has been trained using other people&#39;s work without their consent) is not allowed at all. Sharing links to external articles discussing AI imagery is fine, but if the article will place a preview of an AI-generated image in your toot, please place it behind a content warning.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><li>•ART&#39;s administration team reserves the right to refuse service to anyone, as well as to remove your data at any time due to inactivity of any duration (to help against future unmonitored accounts from being hacked and becoming spam bots), unethical use, or usage against •ART’s CoC/ToS. This includes repeatedly skirting the lines of rules in bad faith without explicitly crossing them, or without attempting to understand and respect the spirit in which these rules were written.</li></p>

<p><ol></p>

<p><li>Federating with Mastodon.ART is not guaranteed. Links between federated instances are temporary and may change or disappear at any time.</li></p>

<p><li>Other instances may not disseminate our users&#39; original content or toots without credit and proper licensing.</li></p>

<p><li>Other instances may not use automated means to analyze any derived work for publication or profit without •ART&#39;s users&#39; consent. This includes serving ads next to copyrighted content originally submitted on •ART.</li></p>

<p><li>Public toots are derived works that are protected by copyright.</li></p>

<p><li>This instance honours noindex/nofollow and search engines are not allowed to index content from such users.</li></p>

<p><li>Crawling the content of the instance and creating a database of its posts and content for the purposes of archiving, searching, or analyzing is prohibited. We value our users&#39; privacy and their ability to control how their data is utilized.</li></p>

<p><b>Alt-Fedi</b> - used when an instance federates with, associates with, and shares the culture of, instances that don&#39;t moderate (and in many cases, actively support) things like harassment, bigotry, hate speech, trolling, far-right ideologies, and generally abusive behaviour.</p>
<p><b>DNI</b> - &#39;Do Not Interact&#39;; instance hosts illegal content such as CSAM, loli, pedophilia, etc. If you want to verify these blocks, proceed with caution; use a VPN or an anonymous browsing service like Tor, and purge your cache afterwards.</p></p>

<p>獣丼はケモノ系が好きな人が集まる日本語サーバーです！
オスケモ・メスケモ、鱗系・人外など、いわゆるケモノ系に理解があればどなたでも歓迎します！</p>

<p><br>
<h1>🖥サーバーの運営について</h1></p>

<p>このサーバーは管理者<a href=""https://kemonodon.club/@aotokage"">@aotokage</a> が個人で運営しています。
何か困ったことや相談事があれば管理者までお問い合わせください。</p>

<p>絵文字の登録は管理者のみ行なえます。登録したい絵文字があれば、
「256KBまでのPNGまたはGIF画像」と共に、「2文字以上の半角英数字とアンダーバーのみのコード」を管理者までお伝え下さい。
もしくは、他サーバーにある絵文字であれば「他サーバー名」と「絵文字コード」でも構いません。問題なければ登録します。</p>

<p>獣丼のメールは「admin@bahamut.kemonodon.club」から送信しています。
メールが届かない場合は上記アドレスからの受信ができる設定になっているかご確認ください。</p>

<p><br>
<h1>✅ルールについて</h1>
このサーバーに参加している人は、下記のルールに従ってください。
これらのルールに従わない参加者には、管理者の判断で投稿の編集や削除・アカウントステータスの変更などの操作を予告なく実施することがあります。</p>

<p>また、これらのルールは予告なく変更することがあります。</p>

<p>（ルールとして色々書きましたが、ケモノ系が好きという共通点を持った仲間同士楽しく交流できればいいなと思います！）</p>

<h2>ケモノ系に理解があればどなたでも歓迎です。</h2>

<p>界隈も広くなり色んな派閥があるかもしれませんが、特定のジャンルを貶すような発言はしないでください。
ここはケモノ系が好きな人が集まるサーバーです。
広義で捉え、オスケモ・メスケモ、鱗系・人外など、いわゆるケモノ系に属するコンテンツへ敬意を払ってください。</p>

<h2>自由に発言してください。ただし、迷惑を掛けたり不快感を与える投稿をしないでください。</h2>

<p>ルールを守っていれば、ケモノ系に限定せずどのような話題も自由にして構いません。</p>

<p>ただし、迷惑を掛けたり不快感を与える投稿をしないでください。差別的な発言、攻撃的な発言は控えましょう。
また、サーバーの文脈を無視した宣伝、スパム、度を越した連投はしないでください。</p>

<p>誰でも見れる公開投稿に設定した投稿は他のサーバーにも流れます。
サーバー内の人だけに送信するのではない、ということを念頭に置いて投稿してください。</p>

<h2>適切なCWやNSFWの設定をしてください。</h2>

<p>ネタバレや長文やネットミームや生々しい話など、あなたが面白いと思っていても迷惑を与えたり不快感を与えることもあります。
そのような投稿はCW（Content Warnings）の設定を行い、警告文で見たくない人が見なくて済むように配慮してください。</p>

<p>成人向けや性的な内容やセンシティブな内容を含む場合、CWの設定をお願いします。テキストだけであっても同様にCWを設定してください。
画像の場合はNSFW（Not Safe For Work）のチェックも忘れずに付けてください。
逆に、未成年の方はNSFW指定された閲覧注意コンテンツを展開しないようにしてください。</p>

<p>また、プロフィール画像やヘッダーにNSFWコンテンツを設定することは止めてください。</p>

<h2>日本国の法律に従ってください。</h2>

<p>日本国の法律に抵触する発言や投稿は禁止です。公的機関の要請があれば情報開示します。</p>

<p>また、犯罪に加担するような発言や公序良俗に反する投稿もしないでください。</p>

<p><br>
<h1>❓利用ガイドラインやよくある質問</h1></p>

<p>獣丼の利用でよくある質問をまとめました。
機能的なところはどんどん更新されていくので、詳細は<a href=""https://docs.joinmastodon.org/"">公式ドキュメント</a>を参照することをおすすめします。</p>

<h2>タイムラインと公開範囲の使い分け</h2>

<p>Mastodonには、
<ul>
    <li>フォローしたユーザーの投稿が流れる<i class=""fa fa-home fa-fw"" aria-hidden=""true""></i>ホーム</li>
    <li>フォローしていなくてもサーバー内の投稿が流れる<i class=""fa fa-users fa-fw"" aria-hidden=""true""></i>ローカルタイムライン</li>
    <li>サーバー内のユーザーがフォローしている他サーバーの投稿も流れる<i class=""fa fa-globe fa-fw"" aria-hidden=""true""></i>連合タイムライン</li>
</ul>
があります。</p>

<p>公開範囲を設定することで、投稿先タイムラインをコントロールできます。また、<i class=""fa fa-retweet fa-fw"" aria-hidden=""true""></i>ブースト機能は、ブーストした投稿をフォロワーのホームに流すことができます。</p>

<p>公開範囲には次のような種類があります。詳細は<a href=""https://docs.joinmastodon.org/ja/user/posting/#privacy"">公式のドキュメント</a>を参照してください。</p>

<h3><i class=""fa fa-globe fa-fw"" aria-hidden=""true""></i>公開</h3>

<p>フォロワーのホーム、ローカルタイムライン、連合タイムラインに掲載され、投稿のリンクやプロフィールからアクセスできます。</p>

<p>ブーストが可能です。</p>

<h3><i class=""fa fa-unlock fa-fw"" aria-hidden=""true""></i>未収載</h3>

<p>フォロワーのホームのみに掲載され、投稿のリンクやプロフィールからアクセスできます。</p>

<p>ブーストが可能です。</p>

<h3><i class=""fa fa-lock fa-fw"" aria-hidden=""true""></i>フォロワーのみ</h3>

<p>フォロワーのホームのみに掲載されます。</p>

<p>外部や投稿のリンクからのアクセスはフォロワーしかできません。また、ブーストもできません。</p>

<h3><i class=""fa fa-at fa-fw"" aria-hidden=""true""></i>指定された相手のみ</td></h3>

<p>指定した相手のダイレクトメッセージとして届きます。</p>

<p>外部や投稿のリンクからのアクセスは指定した相手しかできません。また、ブーストもできません。</p>

<h2>#ハッシュタグについて</h2>

<p>拡散したい場合は#ハッシュタグを使ってください。ハッシュタグを付けた投稿は、
<a href=""https://hashtag-relay.dtp-mstdn.jp/"">ハッシュタグリレー</a>に参加している他サーバーの🌍連合タイムラインにも流れます。
この機能でフォロー関係になくても他のサーバーに投稿を送ることができます。</p>

<p>また、#ハッシュタグで検索することやフォローすることもできます。
獣丼サーバーに送られてきた投稿は通常検索できないですが、#ハッシュタグがあれば検索することができます。
また、#ハッシュタグをフォローすることで、フォローしていないユーザーがフォローした#ハッシュタグを含んだ文章を投稿するとホームタイムラインに流れます。</p>

<p>多機能なので、#ハッシュタグを活用してください！</p>

<h2>フィルタ機能のお願い</h2>

<p>合わないな、と思った人からは静かに距離を取るようにしましょう。</p>

<p>誰にも不快感を与えない投稿を行うのは難しいので、タイムラインを見る際には不快な投稿が流れ得ることを許容してください。
許容できない場合は、タイムラインやアカウントに対してフィルタ・ミュート・ブロックするなどの機能を使って楽しいタイムラインを構築しましょう。</p>

<p>詳細は<a href=""https://docs.joinmastodon.org/ja/user/moderating/"">公式のドキュメント</a>を参照してください。</p>

<h2>通報機能のお願い</h2>

<p>ルールに違反していると感じたら、通報機能やメッセージで管理者に教えてください。各アカウントか各投稿のメニューから通報することができます。</p>

<p>通報いただいた内容は管理者がチェックし、適宜対応を行います。
ルール違反である、との指摘も強い語調で突っかかるとトラブルの元になるので、ルールの押し付けにならないよう注意しましょう。</p>

<p>通報していただいた方に対しては凍結などの対応を行いませんので、それなりに気軽に通報機能を活用してください。通報いただかないと管理者は気付けないので…。</p>

<h2>画像のCW・NSFWや公開範囲についての補足</h2>

<p>イラスト・写真の投稿は大歓迎です！適切な設定を実施していれば、成人向け内容を投稿することも大丈夫です。</p>

<p>成人向け内容が含まれるものにはCW・NSFWを設定し、露骨な性器描写のあるものは修正をお願いします。
法律上明確な基準が引かれていないので修正基準の設定はできませんが、社会通念上・業界的に必要な修正を施してください。</p>

<p>無修正写真や児童ポルノ写真など明確に法律に反するものはCW・NSFWを設定したとしても、公開範囲をフォロワーのみ・ダイレクトメッセージにしたとしても投稿しないでください。</p>

<p>投稿内容の問題は投稿者の責任になりますので、ご注意ください。</p>

<p><br>
<h1>免責事項</h1></p>

<ul>
    <li>システム障害やバージョンアップやメンテナンスで、予告なくサーバーを停止することがあります。</li>
    <li>投稿されたデータは何らかのトラブルによって消失し復旧できない可能性があります。各々でデータ保全などをお願いします。</li>
    <li>投稿されたデータやアカウントに何らかの問題を確認した場合、管理者の判断で削除や停止などの操作をすることがあります。</li>
    <li>このシステムを利用して不利益を被ったとしても、一切の責任を負いかねます。</li>
    <li>このシステムは欧州連合内のデータ主体に対してサービスを提供する事を目的としません。</li>
    <li>個人による運営のため、管理が十全でないこともあります。ご容赦ください。</li>

<p>The Wandering Shop is a Mastodon instance initially aimed at the science fiction and fantasy community, but open to all. We want our 'local' timeline to have the feel of a coffee shop at a good science fiction convention: tables full of friendly conversation on a wide variety of topics.</p>

<h2 id=""funding"">Supporting the Wandering Shop</h2>

<p>Accounts on the Wandering Shop are free for all users, but the reality is a small collective of volunteers invests time and money in running this instance for all our users. Single or subscription donations are much appreciated. Our one-time or subscription donations links are here: </p>

<h2 id=""coc"">The Wandering Shop Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>We want this to be a fun, pleasant, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.</p>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If someone asks you to leave them alone, leave them alone.</p>

<h2>Unacceptable Behavior</h2>

<li>Sustained disruption of discussion</li>
<li>Continued communications with someone who's asked that you leave them alone</li>
<li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment</li>
</ul>

<h3>The following behavior is not allowed on the public timeline:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Graphic violent or sexual content without a content warning</li>
<li>Gratuitous or excessive advertising or spam. It's fine to promote your work, but it shouldn't be the bulk of what you share</li>
<li>Fully automated/unattended crossposting or backfilling from any other instance or social media site/application.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Refusing Service:</h3>

<p>At our discretion, the admins may ban or silence someone if we believe their presence will be disruptive or create an unpleasant or unwelcoming atmosphere, even if they have not violated the rules of the Wandering Shop. We encourage people to individually mute, block, and/or report accounts they don't want to see, but at our discretion, we may take the additional step of blocking or silencing someone instance-wide if we believe they will undermine the safe and welcoming space we're trying to maintain, wreck the vibe, or give the admins a headache.</p>

<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, you may reach out to Proprietor or to any Moderator or Admin. They'll respond as promptly as they can.</p>

<p>We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.</p>

<h2>Consequences</h2>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the admins may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from the wandering shop and identifying the participant publicly as someone about whom we've received complaints.</p>

<p>Be aware that not every user or post you see in your timeline is a member registered on The Wandering Shop. Users of The Wandering Shop itself are expected to adhere to this Code of Conduct. Users from other instances are not bound by our Code of Conduct, but we may silence or suspend them (thus limiting their visibility on the shop) if they are not contributing to the welcoming and inclusive atmosphere we wish to maintain.</p>

<p> If you're using GNU+kFreeBSD, GNU+Hurd, BusyBox+Linux, GNU+Linux-Libre or another variant of the GNU system, you're still welcome! </p>

Los insultos y publicaciones agresivas hacia otras personas o grupos, serán considerada discurso de odio y serán penalizadas. Este NO es un espacio para venir a descargar la ira, insultar o agredir.

No se aceptarán cuentas de partidos políticos, instituciones públicas, empresas privadas y medios de comunicación privados. Sí se aceptarán cuentas de medios de comunicación comunitarios o autogestionados, cooperativas, organizaciones sociales y/o civiles sin fines de lucro y/o cuyos propósitos estén de acuerdo con las reglas de la instancia.

<h2>Acerca del servidor</h2>
Esta instancia fue inaugurada el 25 de abril de 2017 y funciona en un servidor autogestionado, esto es, que no depende de corporaciones multinacionales o empresas, es el resultado del activismo por parte de su operador y las personas que lo administran. Cuando se realizan tareas de mantenimiento, actualizaciones, etc, eventualmente puede figurar como caído durante unos minutos. Siempre dichas operaciones serán anunciadas con cierto grado de anterioridad por la cuenta @admin. En los momentos donde el servidor esté caido, podes aprovechar para leer un libro, pasar tiempo con algún ser querido o salir a caminar y respirar el aire de afuera, que ya volvemos.

<p>This is a queer-friendly general-purpose federated Mastodon instance. You may use it as a personal account, but the focus is on academics. Scholar Social has been described as ""The teacher's break room of the Fediverse.""</p>

<p>Real names and credentials are only recommended if you plan to use your account on this instance for networking purposes; they are absolutely not required.</p>

<h2>Encouraged uses of Scholar Social</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Brag about your publications</li>
  <li>Share references and resources</li>
  <li>Network with other academics</li>
  <li>Put it on the last slide of your conference presentation</li>
  <li>Recruit participants for academic surveys—formal, IRB-approved ones or even informal ones (just make sure to CW them so that others can consent and don't get too obnoxious about it; see the full Terms of Service for details about other research on Scholar Social members)</li>
  <li>Satire and activism are welcome here, but they must make a good-faith effort to punch up. (""Punching up"": making jokes or criticism at the expense of those with more power, higher status or greater privilege.)</li>
  <li>Non-academic, ""off-topic"" stuff is allowed, but try to post this as Unlisted, not as Public</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who is welcome on Scholar Social? Do I need to be a full-time student, teacher or researcher?</h2>

<p>The ""topic"" for this instance is: academia, research, teaching and learning, which is intentionally a very broad topic. You do not need an advanced degree to join (or any degree, for that matter).</p>

<p>If you consider yourself a scholar of any sort, and you are willing to engage with others respectfully, and you will respect our community's efforts to make this a safe space for queer people and other minorities, you are absolutely welcome here.</p>

<p>This instance was specifically started to provide a safe space for queer people and other minorities in academia. Due to the antagonistic relationship that law enforcement has often had with these groups, police officers, military and employees of any law enforcement or intelligence agency are not welcome on this instance.</p>

<h2>Introduce yourself!</h2>

<p>After signing up, post a message to the Local Timeline telling us who you are, what your academic interests are, and helping us to get to know you better. I have set the administrative account to automatically boost public posts tagged with #introductions. (But if you abuse this by using it for anything else, I will close your account without warning.)</p>

<p><a name=""cw""></a></p>

<h2>Content Warnings (CW's)</h2>

<p>Please add CW's (content warnings) that are accurate and descriptive enough to enable reader consent to the following types of posts:</p>

<ul>
      <li>strong language,</li>
      <li>rants,</li>
      <li>selfies,</li>
      <li>current events (includes: US or non-US, local, national, international, and should be applied regardless of whether sources are academic or non-partisan),</li>
      <li>high-conflict or otherwise exhausting issues of popular debate (e.g. climate change, GMO's, privacy issues, elections, etc.),</li>
      <li>mentions of death or violence,</li>
      <li>photographs or illustrations of insects, genitals, wounds (even if they come from a scientific source)</li>
      <li>references or links to Facebook/Twitter/other big tech companies,</li>
      <li>spoilers of popular and recent TV shows or other media,</li>
      <li>ASCII art (this one is important to ensure that someone using a screen reader doesn't have to listen to an attempt to read out a bunch of obscure symbols)</li>
      <li>stresses particular to academia such as grades, exams, thesis progress, academic job market prospects, and</li>
      <li>anything else where another user might want to decide for themselves whether or when they want to interact with your post.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a setting in your preferences to open all posts with Content Warnings automatically, if you don't want to click through each one.</p>

<h2>Image descriptions</h2>

<p>It is an expectation of this instance that you add accurate descriptions to all images and video that you post to aid in accessibility. (A description like ""image.jpg"" that does not aid in accessibility would not meet this expectation.)</p>

<p>If you post an image of a screenshot of text, it is an expectation of this instance that you transcribe the text in the image description.</p>

<h2>The Local Timeline</h2>

<p>Be conscious of how much space you take up on the Local Timeline. This is the instance's ""kitchen table,"" where we all hang out.</p>

<p>Posts on the Local Timeline (ones with the ""Public"" privacy setting) will be checked to ensure that Content Warnings are applied, images are described, and other expectations are followed. Unlisted posts will not be proactively reviewed, but will still be subject to rules regarding abuse and other hate-speech.</p>

<p>Make the first post of a thread Public if you want it on the Local Timeline, and subsequent posts Unlisted. We strongly recommend one thread per academic conference, for example.</p>

<p>NOTE: The ""official"" Mastodon app is NOT recommended for use on Scholar Social, as it does not allow for posting using the ""Unlisted"" privacy setting.</p>

<p>Use a CW or post as Unlisted if you're not sure that your post is ""on-topic."" The Scholar Social Local Timeline is not meant to be a current events news aggregator, and if your post seems to fall into this category, you may be asked to delete and re-draft it with a CW or as an Unlisted post. Let's try to avoid turning the Local Timeline into the same rehashing of the outrage-of-the-day that we see on Twitter!</p>

<p>Not <em>every</em> post on the Local Timeline should be CW'd, but most should. Do your best to try to accommodate each other, and try to be understanding when there is a clash of expectations or needs.</p>

<p><a name=""postsdeleted""></a></p>

<h2>Unwelcome conduct on Scholar Social</h2>

<p>The following will result in: a warning from the admin or having offending posts deleted, possibly without prior notice.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Providing unsolicited advice to strangers</li>
  <li>Inappropriate un-CW'd posts on the Local Timeline (see above for CW policies)</li>
  <li>Posts with un-described images or video</li>
  <li>Shortened links, e.g. bit.ly, t.ly, tinyurl.com, goo.gl, ift.tt, lnkd.in, is.gd or t.co (These are considered malicious because link-shorteners track users without their consent and obscure the destination address, which also prevents users from being able to decide whether they want to visit the link beforehand)</li>
  <li>Advertisement or apologia for cryptocurrencies, NFT's, or multi-level marketing schemes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Exceptions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>DOI links (e.g. https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.k959) are allowed but the post must accurately describe the title/author/journal to allow the reader to decide for themselves whether they would like to follow the link. (In cases of very long titles, you may truncate it, and in cases of long author lists, ""First-Author et al"" will do.) Posts with DOI links where the target of the link is not described, or not described sufficiently, may be deleted without warning.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name=""accountsdeleted""></a></p>

<h2>Things that will get your account closed, possibly without warning</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, able-ism, etc. (will result in a permanent ban, you may not receive a prior warning)</li>
  <li>Serious dishonesty that is hurtful to others (e.g. falsely representing oneself as a member of a minority; services offering to write academic papers to help students cheat; vaccine denialism; predatory conferences or journals; overt pseudoscience such as flat-earther-ism etc.)</li>
  <li>Anything that could be described as ""spam""</li>
  <li>Impersonating other people</li>
  <li>Harassment of any kind</li>
  <li>No bots and no ""institutional"" accounts operated by non-members please; Scholar Social is for people</li>
  <li>Accounts that automatically repeat a Twitter account, RSS feed, etc. must post to Scholar Social as Unlisted, not Public</li>
</ul>

<p><a name=""abuseofmoderationtools""></a></p>

<h2>Regarding attempts to abuse these anti-abuse tools and policies</h2>

<p>Do not attempt to weaponize our Community Standards or anti-abuse tools/policies against marginalized groups such as people of colour, women or queer people. Users of Scholar Social are expected to have the literacy to understand that ""reverse discrimination"" is not real, and so attempts to re-centre discussions of marginalized people around the feelings of the privileged will be taken as manipulative behaviour undertaken deliberately in bad-faith. (E.g. white people should not demand that people of colour put CW's on every discussion of race; a straight person who reports a queer person for writing ""I hate straight people"" may find their own account suspended.)</p>

<p>Elekk stores your email address, which is used as your account name to log you in. Your email is not visible to anyone but the administrators of the site. We do not send you email unless you request it.</p>
<p>Elekk has no advertising partners. Because of the nature of a federated social network, we share your non-private posts with other servers.

We do publish statistical data about the entire body of Elekk users as a way for others to measure the health of our instance, but your individual information cannot be extracted from those figures.</p><br>
<h3>Scraping</h3>
<p>Each user of Elekk.XYZ retains all copyright to the original content of posts they make on Elekk.XYZ. You may not make a copy for any purpose other than the normal functioning of ActivityPub federation and the RSS feeds generated by the Mastodon software of any content originally posted to Elekk.XYZ without acquiring the affirmative consent of the administrator for each post you wish to copy. If you maintain a copy or depiction of any post that originated on Elekk.XYZ, you must regularly check back with the server to determine whether that post has been changed or removed, and you must update your copy or depiction to reflect any changes to the post, or remove your copy or depiction if the post has been removed.</p><br>
<h3>Help, I&#39;ve been suspended!</h3>
<p><strong>If you were an Elekk user and your account was suspended:</strong></p>
<p>Elekk&#39;s moderators use account suspension as a measure of last resort. If we suspended your account, the decision was final, in part because we <em>cannot</em> recover your account; suspension irrevocably destroys all data associated with a Mastodon account.</p>
<p><strong>If you are a remote user and you believe your account or your instance was suspended by Elekk:</strong></p>
<p>As this policy has recently been abused, it has been revoked. Remote suspensions are now final, until further notice.</p></p>

Note aux admins à propos de cette description étendue :
* Essayer de faire le plus simple possible ! Personne ne lira de toutes manières.
* Les versions anglaise et française doivent être synchronisées (Y raconter la même chose).
* Les liens externes s'ouvrent dans un nouvel onglet (Pas les liens internes).
* On ne peut pas faire de Markdown dans du HTML, donc j'ai choisi de rester en HTML.
* Utiliser Notepad++ ou un truc du genre pour y voir clair dans le code.

Notes à propos de d'autres éléments dans l'administration :
* La description courte doit rester très courte (Une ligne), car elle est utilisée dans les métadonnées.
* Laisser vide la politique de confidentialité, celle par défaut est très bien (Même si elle est en anglais uniquement).

94,5910e72f7309a4750c3d397b,ieji.de,False,14174,"<p><i><b>Rules of ieji.de</b></i></br></b>
Targeted misgendering, deadnaming, or promotion of so-called &quot;conversion therapy&quot; is prohibited.</br>
Harassing people in any way, racism, sexism or transphobia is strictly forbidden.</br>
Being a &quot;minor attracted person&quot; / pedophile spreading pictures of minors will get you erased and reported to authorities.</br>
Accounts mainly used for spam, porn, advertisements or backlinking are immediatly deleted.</br>
Do not break german law (no nazis or extremists allowed).</br>
Do not post erotic content without content warning.</br>
Do not spread explicit pictures or copyrighted material.</br>
</br>
<i><b>Short description(TL;DR of the core values)</i></b></br>
This instance is strongly focused on user privacy, we save no IP(changing your IP with 127.0.0.1 before it gets sent to Mastodon), are accessible via tor and yggdrasil and use no cloudflare.</br>
We use an hilarious amount of serverpower to provide the best possible experience, please let us know of any speed shortcomings.</br>
Free speech is a precious good, but it has it&#39;s limits.</br>
We ban bigots, racists, terfs and users that break german or international laws, objections are denied in these cases.</br>
</br>
<i><b>Core values of ieji.de</b></i></br></br>
<b>Safety</b></br>
Our strongest core value is to be a safe place for everyone, if we notice any kind of harassment coming from or going towards our instances,</br>
the offending accounts are suspended without parole.</br></br>
<b>Security</b></br>
We use the latest security technology to prevent sensitive data from being accessed from the outside with systems like CrowdSec and implementing the latest TLS standards.
This includes not using Cloudflare at all as this would jeopardize your privacy as a huge MITM attack vector.</br>
A sophisticated anti-ddos filter from CDN77 in addition to the well known Arbor Networks filter nullify most attacks.</br>
Daily full backups of the database and a daily incremental backup of media files are being made towards a different datacenter within Frankfurt.</br></br>
<b>Performance</b></br>
Another main goal is showcasing how fast mastodon can be by deploying it on the best highest clocking machine money can buy in a one of a kind european datacenter with active-active routing, the usage of CDN77s vast network and using a webserver which enables the latest webtechnologies like http/3, CASPer and quic (h2o).</br></br>
<b>Anonymity</b></br>
The h2o webserver does not create any logs, Mastodon is being given a false IP (127.0.0.1) and we have a <a href=""https://iejideks5zu2v3zuthaxu5zz6m5o2j7vmbd24wh6dnuiyl7c6rfkcryd.onion"">tor hidden service address</a> with https enabled and a valid certificate from harica. Also accessible via <a href=""https://[326:d8ee:6e74:e8a5:a9ab:66d7:7def:b07]/"">Yggdrasil Network</a>. These require acceptance of the tor onion cert. Also an early supporter of WirSpeichernNicht (german for WeDontStore), a movement against the data retention law that was planned earlier in Germany, pledging not to make logs.</br></br>
<b>Features</b></br>
Whatever comes up as features at Mastodon, we implement it, we want you to have the best Mastodon experience there is, this includes:</br>
Full Text Search via ElasticSearch, Translation Service via LibreTranslate and a relay service via AodeRelay, besides some relays, crowdsec and netdata, both very heavy focused on data privacy, no external services are being used.</br></br>
<b>Longevity</b></br>
The service is online since may 8th, 2017 and is here to stay, also thanks to the continuous support from our community.</br></br>
<b>Ecofriendly</b></br>
This instance is hosted at SYNLINQ which houses the servers in the modern maincubes FRA01 datacenter which only uses green energy and energy efficient cooling like the kyoto wheel. </br></br>
</br></br>
<b>Threads.net is blocked via domain block and iptables drop as the company has a horrendous past and does not at all align with our idea of privacy and safety.</br>
Bridgy is blocked, as we do not want to rely on such services and rather promote using compatible standards.</b></br></br>

95,591105917309a4750c3d397c,writing.exchange,False,3630,"<p>We're a stable, long-running Mastodon instance for writers since 2017.</p>

<p>We're an inclusive community that welcomes all, as long as you're kind and respectful to others. We aim to provide an environment where you feel comfortable enough to participate freely and authentically. If you're not interested in that, there are plenty of <a href=""https://instances.social/"">other great instances</a> to join.</p>

<h3>What we're here for</h3>

<p>We're here to discuss and find community around the act of writing. Want someone to critique your writing? Ask the community. Need a little encouragement? We're all supportive here. Swap reviews, share your struggles, set time aside to write together, or just send out small chunks of writing for the community to read.</p>

<h3>Guidelines</h3>

<p>In general, <em>be good to each other</em>. Enjoy talking to strangers (and friends!) on the internet, and give others the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p><em>On commerce</em>: if you are <strong>first and foremost</strong> engaged with the community, please feel free to also talk about your commercial work or projects. We only ask that you don't use our community as a free advertising channel. If you see any Writing Exchange accounts that seem to be pure spam, please report them.</p>

<p><em>On brands</em>: on both the fediverse and Writing Exchange in particular, <a href=""https://gist.github.com/joyeusenoelle/74f6e6c0f349651349a0df9ae4582969#how-do-i-establish-my-brands-presence-on-mastodon"">we're about people, not brands</a>. If you represent a writing-related brand and want to create an account here, we again expect you to contribute to the community, and not simply advertise to everyone. Ideally, your brand account will be backed by a <strong>personal account</strong>, so we know who we're talking to and we can have more human conversations.</p>

<p>If problems arise, please use Mastodon's features to Block, Mute, or Report users that are causing problems. If you need more help, contact <a href=""https://writing.exchange/@matt"">@matt</a>.</p>

<h3>Once you've joined</h3>

<p><a href=""https://writing.exchange/tags/introduction"">Introduce yourself!</a> Communities like these work best when they're filled with strangers who talk to each other.</p>

<p>Then share yourself, your writing, and whatever feels right. We chose the name <strong>Writing Exchange</strong> because that's what we wanted to spark: an exchange. So don't be shy &mdash; trade words with people. Jump into conversations you wouldn't normally join. Share your processes and tools. Put your thoughts out to the community and see what can come from it.</p>

<h3>Support</h3>

<p>We are financially backed by community supporters and <a href=""https://writing.exchange/@matt"">@matt</a>'s small company, <a href=""https://musing.studio"">Musing Studio</a> / <a href=""https://write.as"">Write.as</a>.</p>

<p>You can support this instance with a monthly or one-time donation <a href=""https://opencollective.com/writingexchange"">on Open Collective</a>.</p>

<!--p>If you'd like to support Writing Exchange, you can <a href=""https://write.as/pricing"">purchase a Write.as subscription</a> for $6 per month (and cancellable anytime). Besides helping fund Writing Exchange, you'll get a simple blog that others can follow directly from our instance and the wider fediverse, since Write.as / WriteFreely use the same ActivityPub protocol that Mastodon does!</p-->

<h2>Unavailable Content and Instance Moderation</h2>

<p>We have blocked a number of Japanese instances media due to some forms of loli content being legal in Japan but illegal elsewhere. Given our server is located outside of Japan we took a pro-active stance on blocking media as a ""just in case"" moment. This does <em>not</em> mean you cannot interact with these instances, simply their media will not be cached or shown on our instance.</p>

<p>Some instances we have chosen to remove from our federated timeline. You can still follow accounts on these instances and if you follow a user on one of the instances that does not appear on our federated timeline, their posts will show in your <em>personal</em> timeline. These are mainly instances that tend to be busy and/or are known for overloading our federated timeline with posts.</p>

<p>Some instances we have chosen to block outright. Most of these instances are full of illegal content, hate speech and more. We've also blocked instances that have run harassment campaigns against others in the past. You will <em>NOT</em> be able to interact with these instances from our instance.</p>

  <p>私たちの最大の関心事は、「ichiji.social の利用者が、安心して楽しく一次創作にまつわる交流ができる場を維持すること」です。それを妨げるような利用規約に違反している行為を確認した際はアカウント停止などの措置を行います。
  </p>
  <p>しかし、管理者がすべてのトゥートを確認することは現実的に困難なため、利用者の皆さんに協力していただく方法として、「通報」機能を使っていただけますと幸いです。</p>
  <p>
    なお、トゥートの内容に明らかな違反性が見受けられない場合には、運営チームとしてもアカウント停止などの措置に関しましては慎重に行っており、対応が難しい面がございますため、ミュートやブロックなどで各自で対応していただけますようお願いいたします。
  </p>
  <p>
    また、個々の人間関係に関わる事やichiji.social 以外の場に及ぶ問題につきましても、運営チームでの対応が難しいものとなっておりますこと、ご理解とご容赦の程よろしくお願いいたします。</p>

    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>※サイレンス・アカウント停止に関しては、複数人から受け付けた内容全体から判断し、
    ichiji.social の利用規約に違反している行為と見受けられた場合に、アカウント停止・サイレンス措置を行う場合がございます。
    通報の内容によっては調査に時間が掛かる場合がありますことをご了承下さい。</p>

  <ul class=""incremental"">
    <li>
      サイレンス：措置を受けたアカウントの投稿は、そのユーザをフォローしていない人から見えなくなり、ローカルタイムラインや連合タイムライン等の公開タイムラインに表示されなくなります。また、サイレンスされたアカウントには、他のサイレンスされたユーザしか見えなくなります。※サイレンス措置を受けた場合でも、サイレンスされたアカウントをフォローしているユーザからは該当アカウントのトゥートが見れます。
    </li>
    <li>アカウント停止：停止されたアカウントはプロフィール及び投稿が全て削除され、ichiji.socialの利用ができなくなります。</li>

<h2>이용 규칙</h2>

<p><strong>Qdon은 호모포비아, 트랜스포비아를 포함한 모든 퀴어포빅 발언에 대해서는 최선을 다해 조치를 취할 것입니다</strong>
이용자들은 쾌적한 SNS 환경을 만들기 위해 이용 규칙을 준수해주세요.</p>

<h3>권고사항</h3>

<ul>
<li>남들이 보기에 불쾌할 수 있는 이미지나 글은 <abbr title=""Not Safe For Work"">NSFW</abbr>, <abbr title=""Content Warning"">CW</abbr> 기능을 이용해 주세요.</li>
<li>어떤 것이 싫다고 하는 것을 &quot;공개&quot;설정으로 게시하지 말아주세요. &quot;미등재&quot; 이하의 공개설정을 권합니다.</li>
<li>타임라인대화는 보는 사람이 이해하지 못하고 답답하기만 합니다. 그 글만 읽어도 이해할 수 있도록 문맥을 같이 넣어 주세요. 마스토돈의 글자수 제한은 널널합니다.</li>
<li>자신이 언제든지 틀릴 수 있고 자신도 모르게 혐오발언을 할 수도 있다는 점을 염두해 두세요.</li>
<li>Qdon 내에서 혐오발언을 보았을 때 무조건 비난과 욕설부터 할 게 아니라 상대의 무지함 때문이 아니었을 지 한번 생각해 보세요.</li>
<li>특정 키워드만 가지고 혐오자로 낙인을 찍진 마세요. 민감한 사람에게는 단어 사용 자체로도 트리거가 될 순 있지만, 생각하는 그 의도가 아닌 경우도 많습니다.

<ul>
<li>다른 사람에게 민감할 수 있는 주제는 서로서로 CW 기능을 사용하여 사고를 미연에 방지합시다.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>혐오발언이 보이면 직접 대응하지 말고 신고 기능을 적극 이용해 주세요.</li>
<li>특정 인물에 대한 과거를 뒤지기 위해 검색 기능을 악용하지 마세요.</li>
<li>성별을 나눠서 의사소통/팔로우를 제한하는 행위는 큐돈 특성상 많은 사람에게 불편함을 줍니다. 또한 큐돈은 혐오자 및 차별주의자를 강력하게 제지하기 때문에 여기서는 그런 행동이 불필요하다는 것을 알려드립니다.</li>
<li>자해/자살을 실행하려는 움직임이 보일 경우 외부 도움 요청 등을 위해 빠른 신고를 부탁드립니다. 또한, 자살/자해를 남에게 조장하는 경우에도 빠른 신고를 부탁드립니다.</li>

<p>API를 이용해 자동화 봇을 만들 수는 있지만 다음과 같은 규칙을 따라야 합니다.</p>

<ul>
<li>자동화된 계정의 경우 프로필 설정에서 봇 태그를 활성화 해주세요.</li>
<li>공개제한이 <code>public</code>인 글을 너무 많이 작성하지 마세요. <code>unlisted</code> 글을 권장합니다.

<ul>
<li>단 본인의 블로그 포스트 링크를 제목, 본문의 일부와 함께 자동으로 공유하는 것은 허용합니다.</li>
<li>정보성 글을 트위터, 페이스북 등의 다른 소셜 미디어와 동시에 포스팅 하기 위한 것도 허용합니다.
＊ 다른 SNS에서 일어난 일에 대한 의견 글이 크로스포스팅을 통해 전달 되는 것은 보는 사람이 문맥을 파악할 수 없다는 것을 명심하세요.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>사용자가 먼저 팔로우 하거나 특정 메시지를 주지 않은 경우 먼저 자동으로 팔로우 하지 마세요.</li>
</ul>

<p>이상의 규칙을 위반하는 경우 경고 후 수정 되지 않을 시, 사용자들에게 피해가 가지 않도록 뮤트 혹은 차단합니다.</p>

<p>필수 규칙은 아니지만 권장사항은 다음과 같습니다.</p>

<ul>
<li>정보성 글이 아닌 재미 위주의 봇일 경우, <a href=""/statuses_cleanup"">게시물 자동 삭제</a>를 설정해 주세요.

<ul>
<li>미디어를 올리는 봇의 경우, 다시는 찾아보지 않을 미디어가 서버에 쌓이는 것보다는 오래된 게시물을 삭제해 주는 것이 장기 운영에 건강합니다.</li>
<li>고정된 게시물, 부스트/좋아요 된 게시물에 대해서는 예외설정을 해, 남들이 보관하길 원하는 게시물은 제외하고 잊혀져버린 게시물만 삭제할 수 있습니다.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>모더레이션 규칙</h2>

규칙에 없는 사항이어도 모더레이터의 판단에 따라 조치가 취해질 수 있습니다.
단, 연합우주 외부에서 일어난 일에 대해서는 조치를 취하지 않습니다.</p>

<h3>글 삭제</h3>

<li>사상자가 있는 사건에 대한 직접적인 내용</li>
</ul></li>
<li>기타 남에게 불편할 수 있는 글을 &quot;공개&quot; 설정으로 게시</li>
</ul>

<p>욕설, 비속어의 사용 자체는 규칙 위반은 아니지만 과도한 욕설의 경우엔 CW로 가리거나 미등재 이하의 공개설정을 사용해주시기 바랍니다.
너무 과도한 경우 삭제될 수 있습니다.</p>

<h3>침묵</h3>

</ul>

<h3>차단/정지</h3>

<p>차단된 유저의 글은 저장 되지 않으며 유저와 어떤 상호작용도 할 수 없게 됩니다.
로컬 계정의 경우 계정이 정지되며 30일 이후 모든 데이터가 삭제됩니다</p>

<ul>
<li>TERF 계정의 경우 차단과 함께 로컬 유저일 경우 이메일을 포함한 몇몇 정보를 외부 페이지에 공개합니다</li>
<li>무차별적인 팔로우, 부스트 등의 행위로 관심을 끌려는 광고 계정이나 팔로우 봇</li>
<li>가짜 이메일로 가입을 하는 행위(남을 괴롭히기 위해 계정을 생성하는 것으로 간주합니다)</li>
<li>그 이외에 서비스의 사용 목적을 해치려는 행위

<ul>
<li>규칙의 모호함을 파고들어 규칙의 의도를 무시하는 행위</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>기타</h3>

<p>트위터 등의 외부 서비스에서 제공하는 내용을 저작자의 동의 없이 무단으로 릴레이 하는 등의 소프트웨어는 경고 없이 침묵/차단 등의 정책이 적용될 수 있습니다.</p>

<p>1년 이상 사용하지 않은 계정은 외부 서버에 대한 팔로우가 정리될 수 있습니다.</p>

<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<h3>Short Version</h3>
<p>
    We try to handle moderation ASAP, but we may not see reports for several
    hours. We will get to all reports though!
</p>

<p>
    We're not a free speech absolutist, and there are instances available for
    that. We're not interested in Nazis, TERFS, or hate speech of any sort,
    which we will define at our sole discretion as moderators. No homophobia,
    transphobia, queerphobia, racism allowed.
</p>

<p>
    This instance is meant to be a friendly, welcoming space to all who are
    willing to reciprocate in helping to create that environment.
</p>

<h3>Long Version</h3>

                permission (informally called doxing or dropping dox) may be

                Inciting users to engage another user in continued interaction
                or discussion after a user has requested for said engagement
                with that user to cease and desist (informally called brigading
                or dogpiling) may be considered harassment.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    These provisions notwithstanding, the administration of the service reserves
    the right to revoke any user's access permissions, at any time, for any
    reason, except as limited by law.

<h3 id=""content-warnings-and-sensitive-media"">
    Content Warnings and Sensitive Media
</h3>

<p>
    Our Content Warning (CW) policy is intended to make our server comfortable
    for our community. We are not trying to silence our community or police
    discussion, but ask that you consider those who may read your posts when
    making them.
</p>

<p>
    Content Warnings are a feature of Mastodon that enable you to hide the body
    of a ""toot"" (post) behind a line of text. The intended use of this feature
    is to provide a way to discuss sensitive and/or potentially harmful topics
    without causing duress or harm to anyone who might stumble upon it, though
    content warnings may be used for a wide variety of reasons.
</p>

<p>
    Images can be marked as sensitive. This is a feature which hides an image
    until a warning banner is clicked. Images may be marked as sensitive
    separately from Content Warnings, though using a Content Warning
    automatically marks the toot's images as sensitive.
</p>

<p>Please note that our sensitive media rules apply to profile photos and headers as well. Since those images cannot be hidden behind sensitive media warnings, they are not allowed to contain content from enforced content warnings.</p>

<p>
    We cannot enforce content warnings on users from other instances, but can
    help to manage content that you see when reported to instance moderators.
</p>

<p>
    Please be clear and accurate when labeling content warnings, to ensure that
    they follow both the letter and spirit of the enforcements that we have.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>
        Above all, try to be polite, and come from a place of mutual respect
        when discussing content warnings with other. We do not condone tone
        policing, and want to promote healthy discussion in our community.
    </strong>
</p>

<p>
    This cannot ever be a complete list, and so we want to keep it semi-general,
    and reserve the right to use the judgement of the moderation team to make
    decisions in the future.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Enforced Content Warnings:
        <ul>
            <li>
                NSFW/sexual discussion and imagery must be behind descriptive
                CWs (nudity, sex, kink discussion, etc)
            </li>
            <li>
                Sensitive imagery (please use your best judgement on what
                content that most other users would find sensitive, such as
                photos of surgeries, abuse, war, deceased individuals, etc)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        Suggested Content Warnings:

            <li>
                Discussion of overtly political (relating to elected or
                unelected government officials) topics
            </li>
            <li>
                Triggering topics (direct discussion of rape, trauma, abuse,
                suicide, transphobia, homophobia, etc). The intention is to
                provide a warning for users who may not want to consume this
                content, not to silence users who are sharing their negative
                experiences.
            </li>
            <li>Drugs or drug use</li>

<h2>Code of Conduct <small><i>(TL;DR form)</i></small></h2>
The one big rule here is <em>&quot;Don&#39;t be a dick&quot;</em>.<br></p>

<p>Some more specific rules here are:
<ul>
<li>Respect each other (really, EVERYONE)</li>
<li>follow Human Rights (<i>pretty please?</i>)
<li>Tag your explicit content</li>
<li>Do not use explicit (NSFW, NSFL) avatars and profile headers</li>
<li>No commercial accounts (promoting your own work is absolutely ok)</li>
</ul></p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>Also some not so specific rules:
<ul>
<li>Please post NSFW content unlisted</li>
<li>If you crosspost regularly (or just RTs), please post as unlisted</li>
<li>Please don&#39;t leave you account alone while crossposting (it could be silcenced)</li>
</ul></p>

<p>This list may be extended if needed, so don&#39;t push it.
If you are deemed violating these rules (or their interpretations), you are subject to moderative actions like silencing or banning
<br><br></p>

<h3>Little addition for Bots</h3>

<p>They should:
<ul>
<li>Be marked as such (Bot-Flag)</li>
<li>Please post as unlisted</li>
</ul></p>

<p><br>
<hr/></p>

<h2>Code of Conduct (long form)</h2>

<h3>Scope and Audience</h3>

<p>This policy is for users who have their accounts on layer8.space.</p>

<p>Our instance is only available to users for personal use. Accounts with a commercial background should look elsewhere. Promoting your own work is okay, as long as it is not the focus of your account.</p>

<p><br/><br/>
<h3>Intent and Remedies</h3></p>

<p>Our guiding principle for remedies is that of intent and willingness to correct ones own behavior. It is okay if you fuck up. But we expect you to correct your behavior as soon as we point it out.</p>

<p>Please approach the moderation team with any issues or questions about this policy, or any other policy in this document. We&#39;re always happy to expand in the rationale of these policies and provide advice about being excellent to each other.</p>

<p>If you disagree and reject our requests to fix your behavior, maybe this isn&#39;t the right instance for you.</p>

<p><br/><br/>
<h3>Banned Content</h3></p>

<p>Content that is illegal in Germany is subject to suspensions.</p>

<p><br/><br/>
<h3>Prohibited Content</h3></p>

<p>We have a zero-tolerance policy against bigoted behavior. This especially includes, but is not limited to racism, sexism, xenophobia, antisemitism, islamophobia and transphobia.</p>

<p>This Instance is sometimes viewed in corporate environments, so all avatars and profile headers should be held in a SFW (&quot;Safe for Work&quot;) manner.</p>

<p>Do not argue for the existence or relevance of reverse-racism or reverse-sexism. Racism and sexism are deep structural issues with culture and not the expression of single persons.</p>

<p><br/><br/>
<h3>Crossposting</h3></p>

<p>Crossposting from other social media accounts like your personal Twitter is considered no problem.
But the posts which are visible in the instance timeline should be your own and not something like Retweets.</p>

<p>You also can crosspost retweets, but they should be posted as &quot;unlisted&quot;.
If you mostly post from twitter, then please also monitor you account over here to see reactions to your posts or other messages.</p>

<p>If we believe that your account is left alone and ist just filling the local timeline, you are subject to be silenced from the local timeline.</p>

<p><br/><br/>
<h3>Content Warnings</h3></p>

<p>We ask all users to make use of the Content Warning (&quot;CW&quot;) feature in Mastodon extensively. While this is a hard requirement for any adult or disturbing content, particularly involving discussion about prohibited content, we highly encourage using it as a general disclaimer regarding the content of your toot.</p>

<p>If someone asks you to add a warning to a particular type of content, it is generally a good idea to follow through.</p>

<p><br/><br/>
<h3>Personal Pronouns</h3></p>

<p>We encourage you to add your pronouns to your profile if you want them to be used and also check your fellow users profiles for pronouns before engaging in conversation with them.</p>

<p><br/><br/>
<h3>Discussions and Debate</h3></p>

<p>If you want to start an argument, it is better to ask if the person you&#39;re engaging would be interested in hearing your take first. We&#39;re trying to build a space where conversations are held in a contructive manner. When you&#39;re asked to disengage, do so.</p>

</ul>

<h3>What is Mastodon?</h3>

<p>From <a href=""https://github.com/joyeusenoelle/GuideToMastodon/blob/master/README.md#an-increasingly-less-brief-guide-to-mastodon"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">joyeusenoelle's An Increasingly Less-Brief Guide to Mastodon</a>:</p>

<p>Mastodon is Twitter-style social networking combined with email-style instanced servers. It's named after the metal band, but themed after the extinct megafauna.</p>

<p>Each Mastodon instance is independent but networked, like email servers. If you sign up for an email account on gmail.com, you don't automatically have an account on hotmail.com or aol.com, but you can send and receive messages to and from users on hotmail.com and aol.com.</p>

<p>Likewise, if you sign up for an account on mastodon.social, that doesn't make an account for you on every other instance, but you can talk to users from other instances and they can talk to you.</p>

<h3>What is Plurality?</h3>

<p>From <a href=""https://pluralityresource.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Plurality Resource</a>:</p>

<p>The most simplified definition of the term plural that includes all people who take the label is “someone who shares the same physical body with other individuals.”  Such a group is sometimes referred to as a system, though many plural groups use different terminology.  Because plurality can take many vastly different forms, it is difficult to expand this definition without excluding someone who might otherwise share characteristics or concerns with most other members of the community.  It does seem this basic trait is the only thing groups of people who refer to themselves as plural universally share.  In other words, there are many, many ways to be plural, and no two systems are the same even as far as basic characteristics.  There are a lot of trends in the community, however, and various types within the umbrella term of plural that seem to be subsets.</p>

<p>There is a prevailing theory in the community that sees plurality as a spectrum going from singlet (one person in one physical body) to median (a term describing groups that have one main member plus others who are somewhat separate) to multiple (a group of distinct individuals in which more than one person can take control of the physical body).  Groups who deviate from these subsets are seen as occupying an in-between ground along the spectrum.</p>

<p>More information can be found on <a href=""https://morethanone.info/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">More Than One</a>, <a href=""http://healthymultiplicity.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Healthy Multiplicity</a>, <a href=""https://tulpa.io/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Tulpa.io</a>, or the <a href=""http://www.karitas.net/blackbirds/layman/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Blackbirds' Layman's Guide to Multiplicity</a>.</p>

<h2>Instance Policy</h2>

<h3>CW/Triggers List</h3>

<p>No list of triggers can be complete, but these are some common ones that we ask for content warning / subject line on:</p>

<ul>
    <li>abuse
    <li>alcohol and other drugs
    <li>COVID-19
    <li>death
    <li>flashing or rapidly moving images
    <li>food, eating, dieting, and weight loss
    <li>graphic violence, blood, and gore
    <li>misinformation and unreality
    <li>self harm, suicide, and suicidal ideation
</ul>

<p>Most people also content warn for eye contact, current events / electoral politics, and racism / other oppression they face. We don&#39;t have a rule requiring these because content warning requests have been abused to silence Black users on fedi in the past.</p>

<h3>Bots Policy</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Bots should not post on public privacy. Twitter crossposters and similar automated posts can be on public as long as you also respond to people from your account here.
    <li>Bots must be opt-in; that is, they should not follow or interact with accounts that haven't followed or interacted with them first.
    <li>Bots must be clearly identified as a bot with the ""This is a bot account"" option in their profile.
</ol>

<h3>Federation Policy</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Instances where folks regularly break our rules may be silenced or suspended at any time.
    <li>Now that Mastodon has secure mode, we're not as worried about other folks blocking the same instances we do, but keep in mind that the company you keep does reflect on you, and because of the nature of federation we may find it more expedient to block someone than to deal with the things they federate to us.
    <li>Unmoderated instances and those that make a point of being ""free speech"" have proven time and again to enable harassment and will be suspended.
    <li>Instances running the Soapbox frontend will be assumed to be full of assholes until proven wrong. Using the fancy software that was created specifically for TERFs is, perhaps unsurprisingly, a strong (but not perfect) predictor of transmisogyny.
</ol>

<p><p>The instances that we restrict access to &amp; from can be seen at the bottom of this page. To avoid harassment and legal threats from folks who don&#39;t appreciate that we set boundaries, the reason for blocks is only available when you are logged into Plural Café.</p>

<p><p>We are no longer accepting appeal requests for instance suspensions. We have received <strong>8</strong> of these requests and removed <strong>3</strong> instance blocks after review, of which <strong>2</strong> were re-blocked within 6 months.</p>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<h4>Do I really have to use those content warnings on <em>every</em> post about something?</h4>

<p><p>On public posts and replies to your own public posts, yes. For unlisted and followers-only posts, you&#39;re welcome to add the tag to your account bio instead so that folks know what they&#39;re getting into.</p>

<h4>Why do you discourage the term ""NSFW"" (Not Safe For Work)?</h4>

<p><p>Two reasons.
<ol>
    <li>It&#39;s not specific. It doesn&#39;t tell anyone whether they&#39;re going to see a short reference to sex, kink, both together, pornography, a dick joke, or a joke about the unsafe use of ladders. Everyone&#39;s triggers and tolerance for the different subjects is different, and lumping them all together doesn&#39;t help folks make decisions about what they want to read and when they want to read it.
    <li>Because sex work is real work. &quot;NSFW&quot; might be accurate for most workplaces, but it subtly reinforces those standards on everyone.
</ol>
<p>It&#39;s not a rule violation, but we would prefer folks use words like &quot;sex&quot; or &quot;lewd&quot; in their content warnings instead of &quot;NSFW&quot;.</p>

<h4>Can you give examples of rule 9 (don't take advantage of the rules to try and harm others)?</h4>

<p><p>Sure. One example is sealioning - overwhelming someone with &quot;polite&quot; questions while hiding behind the guidance to be gentle with folks who are still learning. Another that we&#39;ve seen fairly often is, after someone is told off by a Black person for racist behavior, trying to smear that Black person as transphobic.</p>

<h3>Moderator Expectations &amp; Transparency</h3>

<p><p>Moderators are expected to respond to reports and new account requests within 24 hours. Since there&#39;s only one of us at the moment and we also have a full time job, keep in mind that it may sometimes take 16 hours or more for us to get the chance to take a look at things, but we can handle most things in about 30 minutes.</p>

<p><p>Handling reports almost always involves us talking to the folks involved before taking any action, but we aren&#39;t afraid to take immediate action in extreme situations. We&#39;ve immediately suspended accounts from Plural Café for things like:

129,5aa675341a1b3f1036f3d25c,glammr.us,False,1076,"<p>glammr.us is a space for folks interested in productive conversation about, well, galleries, libraries, archives, museums, memory work and records. It is pronounce &quot;glamorous&quot; as our work are often charmingly or fascinatingly attractive, especially in a mysterious or magical way. Sometimes it is also full of excitement, adventure, and unusual activity (oh, yes). It is also inspired by Toys&#39;R&#39;us to showcase the fun playful side of glammr.us tooters. But you don&#39;t necessarily have to only post about GLAMMR-related topics, bring your whole self. Talk about fun things you saw, your exciting day or even your struggles. Many of us are looking for an inclusive and community supported approach to social media.</p>

<p>We want this to be a fun, pleasant, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If someone asks you to leave them alone, leave them alone.</p>

<h2>Code of Conduct and Moderation Practices</h2>

<p>We may give warnings for behaviors such as disruption of discussions, but breaking many of our <strong>Don&#39;ts</strong> will result in immediate account suspension.</p>

<h3>Do</h3>

<ul>
<li>Talk about/link to what you’re reading, working on, listening to, watching</li>
<li>Post your blog post, code snippet, article, book chapter, presentation</li>
<li>Ask for help</li>
<li>Post pictures of your food, cat, dog, baby, signage, face. Show us the awesome/boring/terrible thing on your desk right now.</li>
<li>Use descriptive text on your images</li>
<li>Credit the images and art you share (ideally with a link)</li>
<li>Add CWs (content warnings) to your posts liberally: label talks about politics or hate incidents, listserv commentary, rants, spoilers of TV shows, etc. CWs are metadata. We love metadata! (see FAQ for more about CWs)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Don't</h3>

<p><strong>The following behavior is not welcome anywhere in GLAMMRUS:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, or religion.</li>
<li>Holocaust denial and Nazi symbolism.</li>
<li>Deliberate or persistent misgendering.</li>
<li>Threats of violence.</li>
<li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.</li>
<li>Deliberate intimidation.</li>
<li>Publishing any individual&#39;s address, phone number, or other private identifying information without consent.</li>
<li>Sexual depictions of children.</li>
<li>Unwelcome sexual attention, including sharing sexual content with specific users without consent.</li>
<li>Gratuitous sexual images or behavior without a content warning.</li>
<li>Simulated physical contact (e.g. textual descriptions like &quot;<em>hug</em>&quot; or &quot;<em>backrub</em>&quot;) without consent or after a request to stop.</li>
<li>Publication of non-harassing private communication without consent.</li>
<li>Sustained disruption of discussion.</li>
<li>Impersonation of living persons</li>
<li>Continued communications with someone who&#39;s asked that you leave them alone.</li>
<li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Strongly Recommended Content Warnings</h3>

<p>We strongly recommend considering content warnings when posting Public toots which will appear on the Local Timeline. In particular, we strongly recommend content warnings for following topics:
<ul><li>Hate incidents</li>
<li>National/state/electoral politics</li>
<li>Gun violence</li>
<li>Photographs of insects and other commonly-unsettling animals (snakes,  spiders, just consider your audience)</li>
</ul>
A moderator may contact you and request you re-post a Public post under a CW. See <strong>Understanding and Using CWs</strong> for other suggestions of commonly-CWd topics.</p>

<h3>Required Content Warnings</h3>

<ul><li>Graphic violent or sexual content without a content warning</li>
<li>Gratuitous advertizing or spam. It's fine to promote your work, but it shouldn't be the bulk of what you share.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Institutional Accounts</h3>

<p>Mastodon supports 4 levels of posting visibility: public, unlocked (also called unlisted), locked (followers-only), and private (DM). For institutional accounts we recommend making the first post of a thread public and the subsequent posts unlocked. Anyone who clicks the thread can still see the whole thread of unlocked posts, whether they follow you or not, and anyone can boost (RT) them to share with all their followers. All your public, unlocked, and locked (followers-only) posts will also go to all your followers and we have no concerns about how frequently institutions post on unlocked/locked. To make this easier, consider going to <a href=""https://glammr.us/settings/preferences/other"">post visibility settings</a> and choose &quot;Unlisted&quot; posting privacy as default.</p>

<h3>Live Posting Conferences</h3>

<p>If live-posting conference or presentation commentary to the Local TL, we recommend threading your posts with the first post Public, using the conference hashtag, and the rest unlocked. This will allow others to find your thread but avoid overwhelming other users who don’t have the context for your conference posts.</p>

<h3>Known Harassers</h3>

<p>The admins may ban or silence users whom we know to be harassers or abusers, even if they have not violated the rules of this instance. The mere presence of a harasser can make past or potential victims uncomfortable, and it can put potential victims who are unaware of the person&#39;s history in particular danger. Users are encouraged to individually mute, block, and/or report accounts they don&#39;t want to see, but at our discretion, we may take the additional step of blocking or silencing someone instance-wide if we believe they endanger the safe and welcoming space we&#39;re trying to maintain.</p>

<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the admins. They&#39;ll respond as promptly as they can.</p>

<h3>Moderators</h3>

<p>The current admins are:
<ul>
<li>Contact <a href=""https://glammr.us/@joshuatj"">joshuatj</a> for hosting questions/concerns and moderation.</li>
<li>Contact <a href=""https://glammr.us/@elenarchivist"">elenarchivist</a> for account approval and moderation.</li>
<li>Contact <a href=""https://glammr.us/@platypus"">platypus</a> for account approval and moderation.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.</p>

<h2>Understanding and Using CWs</h2>

<p>Mastodon offers content warnings, which allow one to post about topics while giving others an informed opportunity to decide whether or not to read your posts. Think of them as metadata for your post. Unlike hashtags, which are another great way to find or filter data (and you can use both!), CWs allow the reader to make a choice before viewing something which they may find distressing (such as racist imagery or political trends which threaten their health/job/family/friends) or ordinary things they may or may not want to see &quot;health&quot; or &quot;lewd&quot; or &quot;rant/whine&quot; posts. CWs are especially important on public posts, since we all use the Local timeline. Some people write very descriptive CWs. Others use shorthands popular in the Mastodon community. Common examples of CWd topics and common shorthands:
<ul><li>Politics: &quot;pol&quot; with a country prefix such &quot;uspol,&quot; &quot;ukpol&quot; or more specific clarifications, such as &quot;politics, funding&quot; or &quot;politics shutdown&quot; or &quot;politics, 45&quot;</li>
<li>Examples of hate speech by politicians/colleagues/family/students/etc.: &quot;Hate speech&quot; &quot;nazis&quot; &quot;fascism&quot; &quot;antifacism&quot; &quot;racism&quot; &quot;transphobia&quot; &quot;white supremacist fliers&quot;</li>
<li>Sexually explicit: common shorthands include &quot;lewd,&quot; &quot;kink,&quot; &quot;PDA&quot;</li>
<li>Mental health/suicidal ideation: common abbreviations include &quot;mh+&quot; (good mental health stuff), &quot;mh-&quot; (negative mental health), &quot;suicide&quot;/&quot;sui&quot;</li>
<li>Food/alcohol/drugs/meds: generally just noting the content.</li>
<li>Eye-contact selfies: some mastodon users place selfies under &quot;eye contact&quot; if the poster is making eye contact with the viewer.</li>
<li>Content types: &quot;rant&quot; &quot;long&quot; &quot;whine&quot; &quot;spoilers&quot;</li>
</ul></p>

<p>An excellent longer-form CW example from 2018-01-22 would be &quot;nazis on campus, everyday antifacism,&quot; which conveys that the post both talks about an incident with nazis on campus and the response to it.</p>

<p>Please also keep in mind, that all posts to Public appear in the Local timeline and Mastodon allows you to make some posts Followers-Only or Unlisted. On the other hand, if you see someone posting material which disturbs you without CWs in the main timeline, Mastodon’s mute function will mean you don’t see them. Filters can remove all posts containing a term (CWd and non-CWd) from your feeds.</p>

<p>We are a community for fetish models, photographers, producers and fans. </p>

<p>We are part of the distributed social network Mastodon. It's like Twitter, except it exists as a federation of lots of little communities (called instances) which can talk to each other. </p>

<p>Importantly, these are run by lots of different people, under their own control. </p>

<p>There is no central company which can censor us.</p>

<p>This community is run by the webmaster of <a href=""http://www.restrainedelegance.com"">RestrainedElegance.com</a>; other fetish producers, models and fans are very welcome to join us. </p>

<h3>Fetish/Erotic/Adult performers, models, photographers, producers - posting samples and links to your commercial work here is <span style=""color:lawngreen"">allowed</span> and <span style=""color:lawngreen"">encouraged</span>!</h3>

<p>Each instance has its own rules and guidelines. These are ours. </p>

<h3 style=""color:lawngreen"">Describing your Content When You Post</h3>

<p>Please mark ""Not Safe For Work"" (NSFW) content with the eye button for images AND the CW button for text. It is important to DO BOTH for every post so vanilla users on other instances know what they are getting. </p>

<p>Choose SFW  images for avatars, as they show up on people's timelines in other instances regardless of the viewer's content settings. </p>

<p>In Settings->Preferences, you can set ""Always mark media as sensitive"". (You can also choose ""Always show media marked as sensitive"" too). </p>

<p>Use the CW text to describe the content- I use NSFW, nudity, bondage, BDSM for my posts.</p>

<p>That will make people click on your keywords like ""NSFW, nudity, bondage, BDSM"" to reveal the content (which is kinda cool, actually). You can flag CW's automatically if reposting your twitter feed. More detailed instructions here: <a href=""http://elegancestudios.com/wordpress/?p=27787"" target=""_blank"">HERE</a>.</p>

<p>Describing our content is the Mastodon way of being polite and considerate to the neighbours, so they will have our feeds on their instances. This will mean we can reach scene newcomers and worried kinky people seeking out information, as well as existing fans.</p>

<h3 style=""color=lawngreen"">General Rules</h3>

<p>We are a small and friendly instance and I'd like to keep it that way. So please:</p>

<ol>
<li>No child porn, illegal activities, necrophilia, bestiality or age play (except with people who are CLEARLY adult). It's the law.</li>
<li>Be kind to each other.</li>
<li>Don't be an arse.</li>
<li>No personal attacks or flame wars.</li>
<li>Don't post stolen content or links to stolen content.</li>
<li>That means no Tube sites, sorry. Not even if you actually own the content on them.</li>
<li>Don't post illegal material, or links to illegal material.</li>
<li>Don't flood the place with irrelevant spam adverts for tractors or coffee machines, but on-topic erotica/webcam/OnlyFans/website links are part of what we're here for.</li>
</ol>

<p>The admin reserves the right to kick you off if you're not playing nice; you're a guest in our social media house and I'd really appreciate keeping it a friendly place to be.</p>

<p>Remember that Mastodon is a collective of small instances, so if these rules don't seem right to you, it is very easy to set up your own instance. Please come and link with us when you're set up!</p>

<h3 id=""accessibility"">Accessibility</h3>

<p><strong>Please make sure you caption the images you upload.</strong> Image descriptions, also called alternative text or alt text, are text descriptions of an image. These descriptions support people who are blind, have low vision, use assistive technology, live in low-bandwidth areas, or want more context. The goal of writing image descriptions is to be clear and concise, while giving more context to your post. Here’s a list of recommendations for writing great image descriptions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Capture what's important</li>
<li>Be succinct, clear, and detailed</li>
<li>Be objective</li>
<li>Write out or summarize text in images</li>
<li>Watch out for acronyms and abbreviations</li>
<li>Include the image type details</li>
<li>Use regular sentence structure and letter casing</li>
<li>Avoid redundant information</li>
<li>Take care with complex visuals</li>
</ol>

<h3 id=""media-size-quality"">Media size & quality</h3>

<p><strong>Please reduce your images’ size and compress them before uploading.</strong> Mastodon automatically downscales images to 1.6 megapixels (enough for a 1280×1280 image)<a href=""https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/posting/#attachments"">*</a> and compresses JPEG and PNG with a quality of 90<a href=""https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/4027#issuecomment-314909601"">**</a>, but you can often get much better compression by using free tools like <a href=""https://squoosh.app/"">Squoosh</a> (web app), <a href=""https://tinyjpg.com/"">TinyJPG</a> (up to 20 images, works for PNG) or <a href=""https://imageoptim.com"">imageOptim</a> (desktop app).</p>

<p><strong>Avoid uploading large animated GIFs, videos, or audio files as much as possible.</strong> It takes up a lot of disk space, which means more hosting costs in the end. For videos, you can use the open-source tool <a href=""https://handbrake.fr/"">Handbrake</a> (this simple <a href=""https://theshiftproject.org/en/guide-reduce-weight-video-5-minutes/"">guide</a> written by <a href=""https://mastodon.design/@gauthier"">@gauthier</a> will help you if you don’t know how to use it).</p>

<h3 id=""post-etiquette"">Post etiquette</h3>

<p>You agree to put sensitive topics behind a content warning (CW) (photos must be marked with the eye symbol - after uploading, before posting). Here are a few topics you'd want to CW:</p>

<ul>
<li>Politics</li>
<li>Graphic violence / gore</li>
<li>Sexual content / nudity</li>
<li>Spoilers</li>
<li>Hate topics (racism / sexism / homophobia / transphobia, etc)</li>
<li>Depression / suicide / mental health (you can add (-) or (+) to indicate tone)</li>
<li>Flashing video / GIFs</li>
<li>Drug / alcohol use</li>
<li>Food / diet / weight</li>
<li>Medical</li>
<li>Religion</li>
</ul>

<p>When in doubt, CW. More people than you think can be badly affected by specific topics, or just the current state of our world. If you think that anyone could suffer from reading your content, please hide it behind a Content Warning and mask your pictures.</p>

<h1>FLOSS.social Inactive Account Policy</h1>

<p>In an effort to free up a wide range of account names, FLOSS.social has a policy to delete inactive accounts and associated personal data. An account is considered inactive when (a) no posts have been made on the account and it has been at least twelve (12) months since the account was last accessed, or (b) it has been at least twenty-four (24) months since the account was last accessed. For purposes of this policy, &quot;accessed&quot; means you have interacted with your account through one or more signed-in session from any device. In order to warn the users concerned, an email will be sent to the e-mail address on file for the account providing the user twenty-one (21) days to reply and request an appeal for the account to be restored. Once an account has been deleted and the warning period has passed, it can no longer be recovered. To use FLOSS.social again, you&#39;ll need to create a new account.</p>

<h2 style=""text:bold"">Features</h2></p>

<h3>Mobile App 📱 </h3>

<p>
    Because Mastodon is built on the Rails framework, there is a very niffy
    feature available to users with a smartphone. Instead of downloading an app
    from your phone's play store, when viewing the website in a browser on your
    phone, open up the Browser Settings and select ""Send to Home"". This will put
    an app icon on your home screen that is an app for this instance, fully
    contained, and taking up only a few KB on average. You'll get the same
    control you get as on a desktop or in an app, without the hassle.
</p>

<p>
    That said, there are several apps available for mobile phones, and they have
    not been  tested with this server configuration. Your mileage may vary.
</p>

<h3>Profile 👤</h3>

<p>
    There is more profile text space available then a normal Mastodon  profile,
    so fill it up with stuff about you! Traditionally, Masto users put in the
    preferred pronouns, some hobbies they like, a few emoji, that sort of stuff.
</p> 

<p>
    Your profile picture and header image can include animated gifs as well!
</p>

<h3>Account Verification ✅</h3>

<p>
    You can now also show your ownership of other online sites and profiles by
    adding a link that includes the rel=me meta code! For twitter, this is as
    simple as putting your Mastodon Profile page in the website field in your
    twitter profile, and your twitter profile in one of your mastodon profile
    fields!  For other websites, check your Profile Edit page for more detailed
    instructions.
</p>

<h3>Posting 💬</h3>

<p>
    The post length is set to 500 characters.
</p>

<p>
    We ask that you enable Sensitive Media on all uploads by default in your
    profile settings, out of respect for our neighboring instances. If and image
    you want to share is Safe For Work and does not include any gore, genitalia,
    or explicit acts (would you show it to your mother?), then feel free to
    disable the sensitive filter for that image!
</p>

<h3>Emoji 😀</h3>

<p>
    In addition to the standard emoji you might see on your phone, we have the
    ability to add custom emoji, similar to what you might see in a Discord
    server or Telegram stickers. You can add these to a post by opening the
    Emoji picker or adding the shortcode in the format of <b> :emoji_name: </b>
    with colons at each end of the emoji name. If you spell it correctly, you
    should see some recommended emoji pop up automatically.
</p>

<p>
    Only admin may upload or copy these from other Mastodon Instances. If you
    see an emoji on Mastodon and would like to use it yourself, follow these
    steps:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Start a Reply to the post that contains the desired emoji</li>
    <li>Set the Privacy of the reply to Direct Message</li>
    <li>Remove any other @People from the reply and add @Taris (your admin)</li>

We welcome everyone that wants to be part of the community, boardgamers, RPG players, casual gamers, party gamers, hobbyists, LARPers, game designers and publishers,  RPG characters, artists, writers, vlogers, podcasters, reviewers, streamers, lego builders and more. </p>

<p>This is meant to be a positive and safe space for people to enjoy each other's ideas, opinion and have fun.
To keep tabletop.social that way, the Code of Conduct, Rules and Etiquette will be applied and enforced thoroughly, see below.</p>

<h2>Rules and Etiquette</h2>

<p>
Welcome! Please feel free to join us here, but if you do know that we ask everyone to keep a few things in mind. The following list is not exhaustive, and will be modified and expanded over time. 
Look, if you get it and you you're good with it, great. If you don't get it, figure it out - we can help! If you don't want to get it, maybe find somewhere else to hang your hat.</p>

<h2>Be you</h2>

<p>This is a space to celebrate our diversity. Here you don't need to be a brand, be true to yourself and let others do the same. </p>

<h2>Cultivate a Safe Atmosphere</h2>

<p>Harassment will not be tolerated, oppressive behavior will not be tolerated, and while failure to recognize the boundaries of others may be met at first with a gentle attempt to educate you, repeated failure will not be tolerated.</p>

<h2>Share Things</h2>

<p>Talk about what you are up to! Talk to other people about what they are up to! Make things! Share you patreon! Post your art! Bots welcome (see below)!</p>

<h2>Self Promotion</h2>

<p>Have a have patreon, a gumroads, a kickstarter on the go? Is it your main source of income? We get it and encourage you to share these.</p>

<p>What we don't want the local timeline to be is an endless stream of self promotion. Please follow the <a href='https://gist.github.com/MxFraud/92128019a16c97b4009e6d142b20b7a6'>guidelines</a>.</p>

<h2>On Marketing</h2>

<p>We allow brands, we allow games accounts, but for its social function, not to exploit it for some other purpose.
Company and game accounts are treated similarly to bots and you need to follow the <a href='https://gist.github.com/MxFraud/92128019a16c97b4009e6d142b20b7a6'>guidelines</a>.</p>

<h2> Bots Guideline </h2>

<p>Mastodon has different 'timelines' that different people can see - the Local Timeline is a timeline everyone in this community can see. You post to it by choosing 'Public' (the globe icon) in your post toolbar.</p>

<p>We really want our Local Timeline to be an antidote to traditional social media posting; a more down to earth place where people talk about themselves and what they're up to.</p>

<p>Follow the <a href='https://gist.github.com/MxFraud/92128019a16c97b4009e6d142b20b7a6'> guidelines</a>.</p>

<h2>Banal Bullshit Unwelcome</h2>

<p>There's nothing interesting about homophobia, transphobia, racism, ableism, sexism or any of the other unexamined default settings some people grow up with. 
Being a nazi isn't an opinion, it's shitty and aggressively boring - take it somewhere else. You can feel free to disagree somewhere else where none of us have to hear you. Enforced strictly.</p>

<h2>Standing on the Shoulders of Giants</h2>

<h2 id=""Regras"">Nossas regras</h2></p>

<p><strong>0. A moderação da instância possui o direito de deletar qualquer brilho/toot/tute (postagem) ou conta, ou de silenciar/bloquear qualquer instância, se percebermos que estão causando mais mal do que bem à comunidade.</strong>
<ul><li>Isto se aplica principalmente a quando as regras abaixo são quebradas, mas também se aplica a casos não previstos nelas.</li></ul><br /></p>

<p><strong>1. Tudo o que for contra a lei brasileira é proibido aqui.</strong><br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>2. Tudo o que for postado será de responsabilidade de cada postadore.</strong> Detalhes:
<ul>
<li>Caso outra pessoa faça uma infração pela sua conta, é você quem deve ser cuidadose da próxima vez.</li>
<li>Caso haja alguma infração legal, a responsabilidade não é da equipe do site.</li>
<li>Caso você faça algo contra as regras em outra conta desta instância, sua conta ainda pode ser punida.</li>
</ul><br /></p>

<p><strong>3. Atitudes preconceituosas ou propositalmente irritantes não serão toleradas.</strong> Detalhes:
<ul>
    <li>Há um limite entre perpetuar algum preconceito por acidente por ser a atitude padrão da sociedade e entre insistir que tal atitude é inofensiva/&quot;senso comum&quot;.</li>
    <li>Há um limite entre fazer perguntas e insistência em não entender porque algo é nocivo a um certo grupo de pessoas.</li>
    <li>Há um limite entre fazer uma brincadeira sem saber que alguém se incomodaria e entre insistir na brincadeira porque é só uma brincadeira.</li>

    <li>Mesmo que não seja em relação a uma opressão/discriminação existente, aparente ou conhecida, tente não julgar pessoas por comportamentos &quot;estranhos&quot;, &quot;ridículos&quot; ou &quot;infantis&quot; quando isso não te afeta. Casos extremos disso podem levar a ações da moderação.</li>
    <li>Também evite fazer julgamentos superficiais sobre grupos que você não conhece, especialmente em postagens públicas feitas de forma assertiva. Isso pode acabar sendo visto como discriminação, mesmo que o grupo não sofra opressão sistêmica.</li>
</ul><br /></p>

<p><strong>4. Evite brigas.</strong> Detalhes:
<ul>
    <li>Caso alguém esteja agindo mal, argumente sem depender de insultos vagos, bloqueie e/ou denuncie.</li>

<h2 id=""About""><a name=""en"" style=""text-decoration: none;"">About this instance</a></h2>

<span class=""account__header__content"" style=""font-size: 16px"">Colorid.es (from colorides, ""colorful people"") is an instance focused on the queer/LGBTQIAPN+ community. Anyone can make an account, but don't be surprised if you encounter few het, cis and perisex people here. We take our rules serioulsy, so please read that section before making an account.<br /><br />

Also, this is an instance primarily for Portuguese speakers. People who don't speak Portuguese or who will also speak in other languages are welcome, though, as long as our moderation team can handle it!<br /><br />

We include people who are queer, intersex, transgender, nonbinary, multi-oriented (m-spec), heteroflexible, asexual spectrum, aromantic spectrum, fluid, xenogender, polygender, agender spectrum, non-het regarding sensual/alterous/queerplatonic orientation, astroidian, asterian, non-cis because of culture/belief/life experience, and others in the community. Your hatred for them is not tolerable regardless of your own identity, and will result on a ban.<br /><br />

This instance's moderation team has the right of deleting any toot (post) or account, if we notice it's causing the community more harm than good. See the rules to know more.<br /><br />

If you don't think this instance is for you, <a href=""https://monsterpit.blog/asterisk/asters-mastodon-instance-suggestions"">take a look at this list</a> or <a href=""http://instances.noct.zone/"">this one</a> to find other good servers.</span><br /><br />

<p><br /><br />
<h2 id=""Rules"">Our rules</h2></p>

<p><strong>0. This instance&#39;s moderation/administration staff reserves the right to delete any toot (post) or account, and the right to block/silence any instance, if we decide those are doing more harm than good to the community.</strong>
<ul><li>This usually applies to posts/users/instances that break the following rules, but may also apply to cases which are unaccounted for.</li></ul><br /></p>

<p><strong>1. Anything against Brazilian law is not allowed here.</strong><br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>2. Everything posted by you is your responsibility.</strong>
<ul>
<li>If someone else goes against the rules on your account, you are the one who should be more careful next time.</li>
<li>If you post anything that&#39;s against the law, this is not the responsibility of colorid.es&#39; staff.</li>
<li>If you do anything against the rules of this instance on another account, your account may still be punished.</li>
</ul><br /></p>

<p><strong>3. Bigoted and/or annoying attitudes won&#39;t be tolerated.</strong>
<ul>
    <li>There is a limit between contributing to oppression on accident because of society&#39;s default views and insisting on contributing to oppression because you think certain opinions are &quot;not a big deal&quot; or &quot;common sense&quot;.</li>
    <li>There is a limit between asking questions and insisting on not understanding why something is bad to a certain group of people.</li>
    <li>There is a limit between joking around without knowing someone could get offended and insisting on &quot;joking around&quot; because &quot;it&#39;s not serious&quot;.</li>
    <li>There is a limit between wanting to express oneself and posting many repetitive and/or short messages with essentially no new content. If you want to spam, use the private or unlisted options.</li>
    <li>Even if it doesn&#39;t have to do with known kinds of discrimination/oppression, try not to judge people for &quot;strange&quot;, &quot;ridiculous&quot; ou &quot;childish&quot; behavior when it doesn&#39;t affect you. Extreme cases of this may lead to moderation action.</li>
    <li>Also avoid making superficial judgements about groups you barely know about, particularly in assertive Public posts. They may end up counting as discrimination, even if the groups in question aren&#39;t systemically oppressed.</li>
</ul><br /></p>

<p><strong>4. Avoid fights.</strong>
<ul>
    <li>If someone is acting in bad faith, argue without resorting to vague/baseless insults, block the person and/or report them.</li>
    <li>Even if somewhere else someone made bad decisions regarding a person or group, here is not the place to plan &quot;raids&quot; against other spaces.</li>
    <li>If someone exposes a way to communicate with someone that did something problematic, don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to send messages with violent suggestions to them. If such messages come from this instance, we may take action against this on here.</li>
    <li>Please avoid negatively subposting without content warnings and/or in Public posts about people or groups that could see your post.</li>
</ul><br /></p>

<p><strong>5. Use content warnings when necessary.</strong> Content that needs labeling includes:
<ul>
<li>Politics (as in elections and government decisions)</li>
<li>Blood/gore/violence</li>
<li>Sexual content or content with sexual connotations</li>
<li>Abuse, bullying, suicide, stalking, eugenicism and other negative situations people may want to avoid reading or seeing images about, especially because of their own past experiences</li>
<li>Discussions or warnings about epidemics, pandemics and natural disasters (or other similar dangerous events such as fires) that are ongoing or in recent memory</li>
<li>Discussion or mentions of incest</li>
<li>Negative experiences regarding discrimination (racism, ableism, misogyny, dyadism, heterosexism, cissexism, exorsexism, monossexism, antisemitism, xenomisia, classism, whoremisia, against non-monogamous people, etc.)</li>
<li>Alcohol/drugs</li>
<li>Spoilers regarding media that has been out for less than 7 days:
<ul>
<li> If such media is a videogame, a movie, an episode of a reality show/cartoon/series, a book/text/video/audio which contains a fictional or real story that may be &quot;spoiled&quot; if someone tells its development or ending: content warnings for spoilers are mandatory;</li>
<li>If such media is an ad, an academic publication, a journalistic article/show, or a video/text/audio/image that&#39;s meant to be informative and that doesn&#39;t contain any story that may be &quot;spoiled&quot; if its development or ending is told: content warnings for spoilers aren&#39;t needed, unless such media spoils something that applies to the item above;</li>
<li>If such media doesn&#39;t fit either or fits both of the descriptions above, use common sense. And if you still aren&#39;t sure, maybe put the content inside a spoiler content warning anyways.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<br /></p>

<p><span class=""account__header__content"" style=""font-size: 16px"">It&#39;s not mandatory to use content warnings for other kinds of contents or subjects, but we recommend using them as much as you think it&#39;s worth it. See what other people content warn, for instance.</span><br /><br /></p>

<p><span class=""account__header__content"" style=""font-size: 16px"">To prove you&#39;ve read the rules, put $*@ somewhere in your account approval request.</span><br /><br /></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:bold;"">6. If you want to make an account with the purpose of posting automated content (&quot;bot&quot;), advertising or other kinds of &quot;borderline against the rules&quot; content, please contact the staff beforehand, so we can tell you how you can proceed.</span></p>

<p><br /><br />
<span style=""font-weight:bold;"">7. Don&#39;t steal content, and respect artists&#39;/creators&#39; wishes.</span> Details:
<ul>
<li>If someone doesn&#39;t want their content to be reposted, don&#39;t repost it.</li>
<li>Unless the content is explicitly marked as something that doesn&#39;t need attribution (such as public domain content), every book/song citation, video, image (including avatar/header), ASCII art, etc. needs to be credited, either by a link to the artist&#39;s profile, a link to somewhere that properly attributes the content or by citing an artist&#39;s name and/or the work&#39;s name, unless the work is your own.</li>
<li>If an artist asks you to remove their art from your profile or avatar, you&#39;ll have to remove it.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Regarding interactions with/from users below 18 years of age</h3>

<p><span style=""font-weight:bold;"">Those below 16 years of age should not make accounts at colorid.es.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:bold;"">The following content (which should already be properly labeled and warned/filtered according to rule 5) must not be interacted with by users below 18 years of age:</span>
<ul>
<li>Posts detailing or showing sexual acts;</li>
<li>Posts detailing or showing kinky/fetishistic acts;</li>
<li>Posts discussing paraphilias;</li>
<li>Posts discussing intimate relationships between adults and non-adults involving fictional or historical parties where the age gap is over 3 years between the oldest and the youngest party, regardless of the post being about explicit content or not;</li>
<li>Posts discussing, detailing or showing acts of rape, torture or other kinds of heavily violent acts.</li>
</ul>
Furthermore:</p>

<ul>
<li>No matter the age of whoever is behind the account or whether the content is properly warned for or not, erotic content involving anyone below 18 is not allowed on this instance;</li>
<li>Mentioning accounts of users below 18 in inappropriate posts or sending links to such posts is not allowed;</li>
<li>If content is marked as restricted to a certain age (such as 18+), regardless if it's a content warning on a post or an account, this boundary must be respected;</li>
<li>Since our moderation team doesn't have anyone under 18 years of age, no content in colorid.es can be completely restricted to minors. If someone is a minor and doesn't want interactions from any adult at all, we recommend not making an account on this server.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our moderation team can&#39;t track which posts are or aren&#39;t read, but we want to have a community that&#39;s responsible about one&#39;s own consumption of content. Because of this, we hope our teenage users demonstrate maturity and responsibility by respecting the boundaries established here.<br /><br />
<hr />
<br /><br />
<span class=""account__header__content"" style=""font-size: 16px"">Instances with completely different rules than ours may be blocked. However, slight rule differences (with regards to content warnings for certain things, for instance) may be tolerated. Be careful while navigating the global timeline.</span><br /><br />

<h2>What is Sunbeam City?</h2>

<p>Sunbeam City (or SBC for short) is a young cooperative of individuals whose mission is to promote what we believe to be the values of the solarpunk movement. Part of what we do includes running services that are open to everyone, away from the control of profit-seeking, centralized corporations. We lead by example through using democratic decision-making and sharing resources to run these services.</p>

<p><strong>Adapted from the mastodon.social Code of
Conduct</strong></p>
<p>
  Please note that the rules below should not be considered a legal
  document and may be interpreted by the moderation team of tooting.ch
  as they see fit. This is only an overview which provides you with
  the general moderation policies you'll have to expect when using
  this instance.
</p>

<p>
  Offenses against the rules can generally be categorized as one of
  the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li style=""color: #ee0;"">Minor offenses</li>
  <li style=""color: #e70;"">Moderate offenses</li>
  <li style=""color: #e00;"">Major offenses</li>
</ul>

<p><p/></p>

<h3 style=""text-decoration: underline dotted #ee0;"">Minor offenses</h3>

<p>
  Minor offenses will be handled by removing the content in question,
  hiding sensitive content behind a content warning or issuing a
  warning to the offending user. The risk of facing consequences like
  account suspension after one minor offense is very low.
</p>

<p>
  The following list is an (incomplete) list of actions that count as
  a minor offense:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Nudity, pornography or other explicit material</em> without
  content warning (<i class=""fa fa-fw fa-eye""></i> or <i
  class=""text-icon-button"">CW</i>) and appropriate description</li>
  <li><em>Gore or extreme violence</em> without content warning and
  appropriate description</li>
  <li><em>Excessive advertising</em>, be it manual or automated</li>
  <li><em>Uncurated cross-posting</em> from third-party sources such
  as news sites</li>
</ul>

<p><p/></p>

<h3 style=""text-decoration: underline dotted #e70;"">Moderate
offenses</h3>

<p>
  Content that counts as moderate offense will lead to removal of the
  offending content. Additionally, depending on the circumstances,
  further actions that range from a warning to account suspension are
  likely to be taken.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Racism</em> or advocation of racism</li>
  <li><em>Sexism</em> or advocation of sexism</li>
  <li><em>Discrimination against minorities of any kind</em> or
  advocation thereof</li>
  <li><em>Xenophobic and/or violent nationalism</em> or advocation
  thereof</li>
  <li><em>Stalking or harassing</em> other users or encouraging others
  to do so</li>
  <li><em>Doxing</em>, that is, aggregating, posting or spreading a
  user's private data, or encouraging others to do so, without their
  express permission</li>
  <li><em>Brigading or dogpiling</em>, that is, continuously engaging
  another user in conversation or discussion after said user has asked
  for this engagement to stop</li>
</ul>

<p><p/></p>

<h3 style=""text-decoration: underline dotted #e00;"">Major offenses</h3>

<p>
  If content is classified as a major offense, it is removed and 
  leads to an immediate suspension of the offending account.
  Furthermore, the account holder will be reported to the authorities
  if appropriate and applicable.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Explicit depictions of children</em></li>
  <li><em>Content illegal in Switzerland</em>, such as hate
  speech</li>
  <li><em>Promotion of the ideology of national socialism</em></li>
  <li><em>Impeding other users' access</em> to or degrading the
  performance of this instance or the attempt thereof</li>
</ul>

<p>We&#39;re a Mastodon server for RPG folks to hang out and talk. Not owned by a billionaire.</p>

<p><br/> <br/></p>

<p>We don&#39;t want your <a href=""https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/234876/the-attention-merchants-by-tim-wu/"">attention</a> or your clicks. We&#39;re not the One TTRPG Network To Rule Them All. Just a place for people who enjoy tabletop RPGs to talk about stuff, not at all limited to games.</p>

<p><br/> <br/></p>

<h2>Why Join?</h2>

<p>There&#39;s two parts to that: why Mastodon and why Dice Camp?</p>

<h3>Why use Mastodon?</h3>

<p>As an open distributed social network Mastodon provides some of the things you might like in a social network but with interests more aligned with your own.</p>

<p><br/> <br/></p>

<p>A for-profit social network wants to drive profit through increasing usage and ads as far as possible.</p>

<p><br/> <br/></p>

<p>Mastodon isn&#39;t owned by anyone. Nobody is going to try to show you ads or maximize engagement.</p>

<h3>Why join Dice Camp?</h3>

<p>Since Mastodon is distributed you can join any instance and connect to anyone else (except those blocked by admins, more on that below), so it doesn&#39;t matter all that much which instance you join. Think of it like email: you could have a GMail address or an Outlook address or both or more than that and still exchange messages with anyone else.</p>

<p><br/> <br/></p>

<p>The factors to joining a given server are:</p>

<p><br/> <br/></p>

<p>How many people are on the server? General purpose servers may end up with more signups and have trouble staying stable when, say, a billionaire buys Twitter.</p>

<p><br/> <br/></p>

<p>Does the server have a topic that relates to your interests? While you can connect with anyone the folks on the same server will generally be easier to discover via trends or the server-wide &quot;local&quot; feed.</p>

<p><br/> <br/></p>

<p>Does it have a cool name? Look, there&#39;s nothing wrong with choosing the one that sounds the coolest.</p>

<p>Below are rough definitions as to how moderaters will handle reports and what actions will be taken when a user report is submitted. Of course every report will be investigated thoroughly and punishments may be more or less severe based on moderator findings.</p>

<h3>User level:</h3>

<dl>
<dt><em>User Silence:</em></dt><dd>Minor infractions, heated arguments, frivolous accusations, and centrist rhetoric will result in the user being silenced. Users may still follow and converse with users that are silenced but their toots will not be federated.</dd>
<dt><em>User Suspension:</em></dt><dd>Major infractions, multiple and consistent infractions, abuse, hate speech, illegal content, and right wing politics will result in a full suspension. Users will be unable to interact with suspended accounts and, if the account is based on the instance, the user will not be able to log in or post.</dd>
</dl>

<p><br>
<h3>Instance level:</h3>
<dl>
<dt><em>Reject Media:</em></dt><dd>Applied to any server that allows illegal content and illicit porn. Can be applied to a server regardless of federated, silenced, or suspended status.</dd>
<dt><em>Domain Silence:</em></dt><dd>Reserved for instances whose politics are in violation of guideline 3. Currently consists mostly of Libertarian instances and gnu.social instances that have federated.</dd>
<dt><em>Domain Suspension:</em></dt><dd>Any domain that harbours hate speech, encourages the sharing of illegal content, or where admins have been unwilling to punish users violating guidelines 1 and 2 will be given a full suspension and will no longer be able to federate with our instance.</dd>

<h2 id=""conduct""><a href=""#conduct"">Code of Conduct</a></h2>

<p>Liberdon's community adopts a ""good neighbor"" policy, as one of our goals is outreach to the other communities. As such, ""ostracizable"" (non-tolerated) behavior includes spamming, scamming, nudity* / pornographic / sexual / graphic / NSFW content, advocacy of the initiation of violence, ethnic/racial/homophobic slurs, harassment, or other content/activity that could get this site shut down by state agents with guns. Offending content will need to be removed by the user, and repeat offenders will be banned from the community.</p>

<p>We strive to be ""work-friendly"", so if you post anything that's allowable under our policy but may reasonably be considered objectionable, please use a CW (content warning) to tag it as such.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> If your account is primarily going to use aggregated/auto-posts, please enable the ""This is a bot account"" option in your <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://liberdon.com/settings/profile"">profile</a>, and ensure your bot isn't posting so often that it's overwhelming the local timeline (up to a few posts per hour on average is a good rule of thumb).</p>

<p>Moderation activities will be as transparent as possible, with rationales for each action. The community will have the opportunity to review and give input on actions, and the moderation team will be responsive to that.</p>

<p>Basically, just try to be a reasonable, productive member of Liberdon :)</p>

<div id=""conduct-footnotes"" class=""smaller"">
<p>* Nudity exceptions - the following are okay: Nudity in photos of paintings and sculptures; Breastfeeding (with content warning); Nudity in photos of political expression or significance (with content warning). Examples that don't qualify as exceptions: Nudity in digital art; Nudity with political text simply added to it; etc. Another good rule of thumb is ""use common sense"" ;)</p>

<h3>What is 'bird site'?</h3>

<p>It's a legacy social media site also known as 'Twitter'.</p>
","Liberdon is an instance for libertarians, ancaps, anarchists, voluntaryists, agorists, etc to sound off without fear of reprisal. It was created in the wake of the Great Twitter Cullings of 2018.",Liberdon,
160,5b710f52ba0ea153975ca201,kopiti.am,False,1258,"<h2>History</h2>

<p><a href=""https://kopiti.am/@echoz"">@echoz</a> first got the idea when more of his friends on Twitter started using Mastodon. Upon seeing how it worked by federating across multiple instances, a slight twinge of <a href=""https://kopiti.am/@echoz/100540347220280555"">nostalgia</a> was felt. It seemed like it was a worthwhile endeavor to try and setup a local instance for Singaporeans to connect from and to build a local community that also participates in the greater <a href=""https://fediverse.network"">Fediverse</a>.</p>

<p>What came next was a few days of trying to figure out a name for the place and credit must be given to mrbrown for the name, as obvious as it may be. The fact that Armenia had a TLD that ended in .am also definitely helped a lot.</p>

<p><a href=""https://kopiti.am/@lxcid"">@lxcid</a> took on the task of setting up the various components of Mastodon on the Google Cloud Platform since he had the most experience there.</p>

<p>We have plans to enrich the experience here so stay tuned for that!</p>

<h2>Administration Team</h2>

<li>Announcement and Instance specific bot (<a href=""https://kopiti.am/@towkay"">@towkay</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point in time, we are currently not looking for a moderation team but are always open to suggestions for how to improve this instance.</p>

<h2>Costs</h2>

<p>In the interest of transparency as to how reliable and real this is, we're listing some of our costs as this gets brought up. It will be updated as we have more information as we add more users and run our projections</p>

<p>Please remember that being on this server is a privilege, and not a right.</p>

<p>The following guidelines are not a legal document, and final interpretation is up to the administration of phpc.social; they are here to provide you with an insight into our content moderation policies.</p>

        <li>Nudity, pornography, and sexually explicit content, including artistic depictions, without an appropriate Content Warning</li>
        <li>Gore and extremely graphic violence, including artistic depictions, without an appropriate Content Warning</li>

        <li>Incitement of violence against individuals or groups</li>
    </ol></li>
    <li>The following types of content are explicitly disallowed and will result in immediate and permanent revocation of access to the service:<ol>

    <li>Any conduct intended to stalk or harass other users, or to impede other users from utilising the service, or to degrade the performance of the service, or to harass other users, or to incite other users to perform any of the aforementioned actions, is also disallowed, and subject to punishment up to and including revocation of access to the service.

        <li>Aggregating, posting, and/or disseminating a person's demographic, personal, or private data without express permission (informally called doxing or dropping dox)</li>
        <li>Inciting users to engage another user in continued interaction or discussion after a user has requested for said engagement with that user to cease and desist (informally called brigading or dogpiling)</li>
    </ol></li>
</ol>

<p>These provisions notwithstanding, the administration of the service reserves the right to revoke any user's access permissions, at any time, for any reason, except as limited by law.</p>

<p><hr class=""spacer""></p>

<h2>Moderation Procedures</h2>

<h3>Cross-Instance Moderation</h3>

<p>First, a few notes on how cross-instance moderation works:</p>

<ol>
    <li>If a remote user is reported from our instance, the report is immediately forwarded to the home of the remote user.</li>
    <li>Suspension of a remote user only makes them invisible from, and unable to react to, users on our instance.</li>
    <li>Any moderation actions we take with regard to a remote user are not relayed back to that user’s home instance.</li>
    <li>Our view of remote users does not include any information (email, IP address, etc.) that would allow us to proactively block that user from interacting with our instance outside the context of the account they’re currently on.</li>
</ol>

<p>With that said, if user A on our instance reports user B on another instance for harassment/hate speech or similar-tier offences, moderators can and should take proactive action comparable to if the harassment had been directed at a user on our instance, even if the reported user has had no interactions with our instance (including follows in either direction). So if the remote user’s feed is exclusively hate speech, suspend that user.</p>

<h3>Proactive vs. Reactive Moderation</h3>

<p>Moderators are not obligated, as part of their role, to actively seek out accounts or posts that break our rules or would result in a report. Moderators, like any user of our instance, can use reporting functionality for bad actors that they see during their own use of the platform, and can even take moderation actions directly without going through the report system if they see something sufficiently egregious, though in those cases moderators should post in Discord with what they've done as an audit trail on top of the one built into Mastodon.</p>

<p>With that said, moderators’ primary duty is to assist in resolving reports made by other users in a timely and consistent manner. This means that the role of a moderator is primarily reactive rather than proactive, and we’re knowingly making the tradeoff of catching things quickly to balance workload on a fully-volunteer moderation staff.</p>

<h3>Best Practices</h3>

<p>This section contains a set of guidelines on how to best use this instance. They include suggestions for when to use Content Warnings. (Mostly copied from <a href=""https://blog.chaos.social/rules"">https://blog.chaos.social/rules</a>):</p>

<p>We ask users on phpc.social to keep the following guidelines in mind, in order to foster a considerate and accessible atmosphere. Forgetting about them is not as serious as breaking the instance rules, but repeated malicious unwillingness to follow the best practices will be considered just like breaking a rule.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Use content warnings liberally, especially for topics that are potentially disturbing or controversial, or that make life harder for people struggling with addiction or trauma, but also for spoilers.</li>
    <li>Set the right language for your posts. By default Mastodon will use the interface language to attach to your posts, but if you (for example) have set that to English, and you post in German, then the posts will have ""English"" attached to them, and translations don’t work.</li>
    <li>Add descriptions to images and videos.</li>
    <li>Provide credit for creative works that are not your own.</li>
    <li>Don't be a reply guy – uninvited comments about another user’s personal choices, lifestyle, or family are strongly discouraged and may be considered harassment.</li>
    <li>In discussions, please remain civil, do not insult the people you’re talking to. Don’t escalate.</li>
</ul>

<p><hr class=""spacer""></p>

<h2>Reporting Harassment</h2>

<p>To report harassment, click the three vertical dots (⋮) on a user's profile and select ""Report @user."" For urgent concerns, you may contact us at <a href=""mailto:hello@phpcommunity.org"">hello@phpcommunity.org</a>.</p>

<h1>Admin Note</h1>

<p>Hello new neighbour, and welcome to Aus.Social! This place is growing every day and I&#39;ve found real community and value here. I hope you all have a great time.</p>

<p>Aus.Social is a &quot;progressive&quot; instance, and we recommend you read the rules to get an understanding of what that means to us. Good faith Comedy, humour, shitposting, memes and content is welcome here.</p>

<p>I will utilise my professional experience to secure our services, but Pwease no hacky 👉 👈 🥺</p>

<p>Any posts that punch down or break our rules will likely result in moderation action.</p>

<h1>Eligibility</h1>

<p>Aus Social is a community of people, not a billboard. We exist as a safe stable place for people to join and communicate with their friends and our greater community. We will not accept many brands and businesses that do not focus on community building.</p>

<p>We accept signups from any person aged 15 or older anywhere in the world; while our user base is primarily in the Australian  (UTC+8 to UTC+11) time zones, we operate 24/7. We do not require or enforce English (Moderators may use automated translation to spot-check posts for adherence to our code of conduct).
This server may host content that expresses sexuality, body positivity, and other adult themes. If this is of personal concern, we recommend joining another instance. (There are alternative instances, such as <a href=""https://theblower.au"">https://theblower.au</a> that are safe for minors.)</p>

<h2>Companies are not allowed</h2>

<p>We do not accept companies and corporate brands here. These guidelines clarify our expectations:</p>

<p><code>Joe from Joe’s Plumbing</code> is fine, <code>Joe’s Plumbing</code> is not. You may add links to a business you are connected to in your profile, just do not use your feed to regularly share ads.</p>

<p>Below is a small sample of accounts we will and will not accept. These are common examples which hopefully set the tone of our instance. Please contact us if you are unsure if this applies to you, and our  team can review your request to join on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h3>Generally Not Allowed Accounts</h3>

<p>We want to limit advertising, marketing, brands and promotion, while none of these are banned. In order to reach this goal, the administrator has banned a few kinds of accounts:

-   Newspapers and News Outlets
-   Mainstream Television Networks
-   Marketing, Advertising and Promotion
-   Political Parties (politicians or political figures are welcome)
-   Lobby Groups / Astroturf fronts</p>

<p>This is only for the businesses themselves. Workers of all stripes are welcome. There are other instances that welcome brands, and we’ll direct any accounts that break these guidelines to those instances.</p>

</ul>

<hr>

<h1>User Code of Conduct (Rules)</h1>

<p>The following types of content will be removed, which will result in account suspension and revocation of access to the service:</p>

<li>  Any content we deem harmful or distressing</li>
</ul>

<p>Please report posts or users breaking the code of conduct, but please do not message people on behalf of the moderation team. Instead, you can scroll on, block, mute, or report to let moderators deal with it.</p>

<p>The following types of content are explicitly disallowed and will result in revocation of access to the service:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Conduct promoting the ideology of National Socialism (Seriously. Absolutely no Nazis!)</li>
<li>  Holocaust denial, Nazi symbolism, or similar content</li>
<li>  White supremacy. </li>
<li>  Violence: Do not make specific threats of violence or wish for the serious physical harm, death, or disease of an individual or group of people. This includes, but is not limited to, threatening or promoting terrorism. Do not affiliate with organisations that — whether by their own statements or activity both on and off the platform — use or promote violence against civilians to further their causes</li>
</ul>

<h2>-   Child exploitation: you may not post sexually suggestive or exploitive images of minors in any way (regardless of context). Example: No bath photos</h2>

<h1>Content Warning (CW) and Hashtag Guidelines</h1>

<p>Hashtags are heavily encouraged as the primary way for others to discover your themed content, while also allowing people to quickly filter content they do not wish to see on their feeds. Please note that hashtags must be used in the main body of a post - they do not work when used in the CW. To aid readability by humans and screen readers, please CamelCase #HashTags (capitalise the first letter of each word).</p>

<p>We encourage the use of Content Warnings (aka Content Wrappers, Summaries, Topics, Subject lines) on your posts. CWs are a courtesy to your readers and other members of the Aus Social community. CWs are not self-censorship: they do not suppress the indexing of posts, only their initial visibility. Aus.Social believes that CWs are an important tool to support people&#39;s self-autonomy, but they can also be used for expression and creativity.</p>

<p>Admin Note: CWs are not expected on posts made by historically and/or socially marginalised people about their own lived-experiences or activism, though authors may choose to do so.</p>

<h2>Expected CWs and Hashtags</h2>

<p>Everybody on Aus.Social must use Content Warnings (CWs) and hashtags for the following topics:</p>

<p>Politics, including party politics, electoral politics, geopolitic, elections and general governmental drama.
Please use a <code>AusPol</code> CW and/or <code>#AusPol</code> Hashtag.
Same with #USPol/#UKPol/#GeoPol etc
Adult Content including Nudes / Lewds / NSFW posts
Please use a CW (and any suitable hashtags)
Advertising of products/brands (CW)
Please use a CW (and any suitable hashtags)
Depictions of violence and gore (CW)
Please use a CW (and any suitable hashtags)</p>

<p>If you regularly post without using CWs or Hashtags for these topics, it will be both harder for those of us looking for #AusPol, and those looking to filter them. It will very likely result in other people reporting your posts, and our moderation team will be in touch with you to ask nicely to use CWs and Hashtags.</p>

<h2>Recommended CWs</h2>

<p>The following is a list of topics which have been commonly used by people on Mastodon/Aus Social CWs in the past.</p>

<p>A 2022 survey of public posts on the Aus Social local timeline showed that CWs had been used for the following topics. This list is advisory and intended only as a guide to the culture of Aus Social!</p>

<h1>Our Responsibilities</h1>

<p>The administrator and moderators will endeavour to:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Keep the atmosphere of the server as welcoming and enjoyable as possible.</li>
<li>  Keep this server online and functional for as long as possible.</li>
<li>  Clarify the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will not act on complaints regarding:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Criticising racist, sexist, or otherwise oppressive behaviour or assumptions.</li>
<li>  Good faith and non-malicious conduct whose object is to ameliorate (improve) the conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups.</li>
<li>  Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as &quot;leave me alone,&quot; &quot;go away,&quot; or &quot;I’m not discussing this with you&quot;.</li>
<li>  Swearing or profanity.</li>
</ul>

<p>Admin note: People are going to fight on the internet (this is a communication platform), and we generally try to ask people to block/mute people and take control of their social network experience as much as possible for situations where escalating to the moderation team via a report is not required... for issues that don&#39;t break any rules, but are still of concern to those involved (in or out of the fighting), Our moderation team might refuse to act as a mediator, but they will respond when (lines are crossed or) rules are broken.</p>

<h1>Moderator code of conduct</h1>

<p>Aus Social has a number of users who are also designated moderators. These moderators are currently <a href=""https://aus.social/@Bennytek"">@Bennytek</a> <a href=""https://aus.social/@Dangerous_beans"">@Dangerous_beans</a> <a href=""https://aus.social/@morachbeag"">@morachbeag</a> <a href=""https://aus.social/@prk"">@prk</a> <a href=""https://aus.social/@whatshisays"">@whatshisays</a> <a href=""https://aus.social/@KarenWyld"">@KarenWyld</a> <a href=""https://aus.social/@harrym"">@harrym</a> <a href=""https://aus.social/@grumpysmiffy"">@grumpysmiffy</a>. [Updated: 3rd Feb 2024]</p>

<p>Moderators can, in addition to any public information posted by users, see:</p>

<ul>
<li>  How many posts a user has made</li>
<li>  All of a user&#39;s public, unlisted and followers-only posts, even if the account is configured to require approval for followers</li>
<li>  By extension, how many direct messages a user has written (but not the recipients or contents)</li>
<li>  A user&#39;s recently-used IP addresses</li>
<li>  A user&#39;s registered email address</li>
<li>  Whether a user has 2-factor authentication turned on</li>
<li>  A user&#39;s interface language</li>
<li>  Previous reports made by and against other users</li>
<li>  Notes about a user&#39;s account made by other moderators</li>
</ul>

<p>Moderators may only use the above information to:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Suspend, warn, or limit the visibility of a user who has broken server rules</li>
<li>  Delete or limit the visibility of posts that break server rules</li>
<li>  Respond to a report made by or about a user</li>
</ul>

<p>Any other use, including in aggregate, requires approval by <a href=""https://aus.social/@aussocialadmin"">@aussocialadmin</a>.</p>

<p>Moderators have no access to a user&#39;s direct messages (sent or received), phone numbers, or which posts they have bookmarked.</p>

<p>Moderators have the ability to view all reports made by and about Aus Social users, including historical resolved reports. Moderators can see the reported posts (which might be direct messages) and the accompanying report comment made by the reporter.</p>

<p>Moderators should reach a consensus about the result of a report (especially if it is not a clearcut decision), but a moderator can act unilaterally if end user safety is a factor or if actions are clearly informed by precedent. Moderation decisions may be reversed once further discussion between moderators has occurred.</p>

<p>Moderators may defederate Aus Social from an instance that is harmful to Aus Social users. This may happen if the remote instance does not sufficiently moderate its users or if its principles are incompatible with Aus Social&#39;s.</p>

<p>Moderators may place IP blocks or email domain blocks on signups to limit account signups that break Aus Social rules.</p>

<p>Moderators may contact the creator of a report and advise them of the outcome.</p>

<p>Moderators&#39; decisions may be overridden by <a href=""https://aus.social/@aussocialadmin"">@aussocialadmin</a>, whose decision is final.</p>

<p class=""about-update""><strong>Registration policy update:</strong> It seems like the previous threshold for new accounts -- writing anything sensible in the ""reasons for joining"" section -- is no longer sufficient. So in order for your account to be considered, please ensure to write something about why you think Ruby.social is the right instance for you. If you just want a Mastodon account, you should probably sign up at one of the larger instances instead.</p>

<p>This Mastodon instance is for people interested in <em>Ruby</em>, <em>Rails</em>, and <em>Ruby-related topics</em>, <a href=""https://mastodon.xyz/@jmcharnes/100606321863664252"" title=""You didn't quite make the 25 new members, but we like the joke anyway"">AKA #matztodon 😄</a></p>

<p>For anyone who's interested in or working with Ruby, or related technologies. We want to be a <em>friendly community of communities</em>, discovering new people and welcoming them into the happiness that is programming with Ruby :-)</p>

<p>Discussions don't need to be about Ruby, but you'll get more out of this instance if that's one of your interests.</p>

<p>We take a strong stance against spam, and are moderating all signups. We are not anti-company or anti-promotion, but either applies to you, you will need to demonstrate your relevance to the community. This minimal barrier exists purely to stem the tide of spam accounts and profiles we've seen -- all genuine people and companies are otherwise welcome.</p>

<p>While we hope ruby.social becomes a great place to talk about Ruby and discover fellow rubyists, discussions are not limited to that, though; you can talk about anything you want as long as you follow the Code of Conduct.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Current:</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://ruby.social/@james"">@james</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id=""blocked-instances"">Blocked instances</h2>

<p>We block some other instances. The full list is available to our users and we welcome feedback and suggestions. There are plenty of ""Free Speech Zones"" on the internet, but this is not one of them, and this instance will not openly federate with instances self-describing in that way.</p>

<h2 id=""companies-and-randoms"">Companies and random accounts<h2>

<p>We want ruby.social to be a useful and interesting place principally for <em>people</em> to interact and post. For that reason, our default position is that companies and random user accounts that are (in the judgement of the moderators) posting content <em>not</em> relevant to our community will be politely asked to move their accounts to other instances. There is a place in the Fediverse for every account, but that place might <em>not</em> be this instance.</p>

<p>This doesn't apply to <em>all</em> companies; all accounts are warmly welcome as long as they are relevant (e.g. a product or development company that is connected with Ruby), show clear intent to engage with the community, and of course that they adhere to the specific rules below (particularly w.r.t advertising).</p>

<h2 id=""handling-harassment"">Handling harassment</h2>

<p>If you are being harassed, please report the user using the ""…"" button and then ""Report."" For urgent concerns, please DM a moderator.</p>

<p>If you engage in harassing behavior, the moderator may take any action they deem appropriate, such as a warning or an expulsion.</p>

<p>The above rules may change at any time, and you may be banned at any time based on the moderators' judgment.</p>

<h2 id=""privacy-policy"">Privacy policy</h2>

<p>What will we do with your data? Nothing. How will you be influenced by advertisers? You won't; brands and non-humans (other than fun/useful bots) are banned. How will we aggregate your data in order to improve your service… none of that.</p>

<p>We will never share your data with anyone else, except in the case of valid legal requests if it comes to that. (Hopefully it won't come to that!)</p>

<p>More privacy measures on ruby.social:</p>

<ul>
<li>EXIF data (GPS location, date, camera type, etc.) is <a href=""https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/85"">stripped from images</a> and never stored.</li>
<li>HTTPS is used everywhere.</li>
<li>No ads or trackers.</li>
<li>Links are direct URLs rather than tracking redirects.</li>
</ul>

<p>Understand though that this instance is run by me and my friends, and (as is the case with all Mastodon servers) we potentially have access to your data, including DMs. The back-end is also not encrypted. If this is not okay with you, this might not be the instance for you.</p>

<p>Also, for truly private data sent between two people, Mastodon offers no E2E encryption. So use Signal or WhatsApp for the things you really want to be private.</p>

<h2 id=""discussion-and-feedback"">Discussion and Feedback</h2>

<h2>Verhaltensregeln</h2>

<p>Wir haben für die Nutzung gewisse Serverregeln erstellt, die Ihr etwas weiter unten auf dieser Seite findet und die Ihr mit der Erstellung eines Accounts bei muenchen.social akzeptiert. Bitte beachtet, andere Instanzen haben andere Regeln. Was hier erlaubt ist, kann dort verboten sein und umgekehrt. Wenn Ihr Verstöße erkennt, könnt Ihr diese über das Meldesystem melden. Bitte seit dort so genau wie möglich und gebt uns ggf. Zusatzinformationen, damit wir den Vorfall besser (und schneller) einordnen können. Damit helft Ihr uns. Bei Verstößen gegen die Serverregeln kann es zu einer Löschung der Beiträge und auch zur Löschung des verursachenden Accounts kommen. Bitte beachtet, dass es keine Rückmeldung gibt, was mit Eurer Meldung geschieht.</p>

<h2>Relaying</h2>

<p>Es besteht ein aktives Relay mit der Instanz sueden.social</p>

<h3>Was bedeutet Relaying?</h3>

<p>Alle Nachrichten (Toots), die öffentlich markiert sind und auf der lokalen Zeitleiste erscheinen, werden zusätzlich auf den o.g. Relay übergeben und somit  zusätzlich in den lokalen Zeitleiste auf den teilnehmenden anderen Instanzen eingeblendet. Dies fördert kleinere Instanzen um mehr Inhalte in der lokalen Zeitleiste angezeigt zu bekommen. Ihr müsst hierzu selbst nichts machen, dies geschieht automatisch.</p>

<h2>Server</h2>

<p>Der Standort aller benötigten Server für muenchen.social ist in Deutschland.
<h2>Serverstatus</h2>
Über https://monitor.martinmuc.de könnt Ihr einsehen, ob die Server derzeit erreichbar sind.
<h2>Backups</h2>
Aktuell wird einmal (1x) täglich ein inkrementelles Backup von folgenden Daten erstellt
<ul>
<li>Alle notwendigen Konfigurationsdateien des Betriebssystems</li>
<li>Konfigurationsdateien/Webordner usw. von Mastodon selbst</li>
<li>Datenbank</li>
</ul>
Die Backups werden verschlüsselt und auf einen gesonderten Backupserver in Deutschland übertragen. Es werden für die letzten 7 Tage und je ein Backup der letzten 4 Wochen aufgehoben um auch bei einem Problem, dass nicht sofort erkannt wird, noch zurückgreifen zu können.</p>

<h2>Spenden</h2>

<p>muenchen.social wird privat betrieben und es gibt weder Werbung noch Tracking, noch findet ein Verkauf Eurer Daten statt. Deswegen würde ich mich freuen, wenn Ihr Euch in Form einer Spende beteiligen könnt. Auch kleine Beträge helfen.
Unter <a href=""https://martinmuc.de/spenden"">https://martinmuc.de/spenden</a> erfahrt Ihr die Gesamtkosten für den Betrieb und erfahrt, wie Ihr spenden könnt.</p>

    <em>""Be excellent to each other""</em> ist leichter gesagt als getan und bedeutet für jeden etwas anderes.
</p>

<p>
    Bei den folgenden Regeln handelt es sich um eine (nicht erschöpfende) Liste von Verhaltensweisen, die nach dem Ermessen der Instanzmoderatoren zur Löschung von Toots, Stummschaltung oder Sperrung von Konten führen können, wie in unseren <a href=""/terms"">Nutzungsbedingungen</a> geschrieben.
</p>

<p>
    Bitte melde Verhaltensweisen, die dich stören. Wir werden deine Meldung vertraulich behandeln.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Wir dulden kein diskriminierendes Verhalten und keine Inhalte, die die Unterdrückung von Angehörigen von Randgruppen fördern oder befürworten. Diese Gruppen können durch eine der folgenden Merkmale gekennzeichnet sein (wobei diese Liste natürlich unvollständig ist):
        <ul>
            <li>Ethnizität</li>
            <li>Geschlechtsidentität oder -ausdruck</li>

    <li>Wir dulden kein bedrohliches Verhalten, Stalking und <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxxing"">Doxxing</a>.</li>
    <li>Wir dulden keine Belästigung, einschließlich Brigading, Dogpiling oder jede andere Form der Kontaktaufnahme mit einem Nutzer, der angegeben hat, dass er nicht kontaktiert werden möchte.</li>
    <li>Wir dulden kein Mobbing, einschließlich Beschimpfungen, absichtliche Falschbenennung oder Deadnaming.</li>
    <li>Wir dulden keine gewalttätige nationalistische Propaganda, keine Nazi-Symbolik und keine Förderung der Ideologie des Nationalsozialismus.</li>
    <li>Wir dulden keine Verschwörungsnarrative oder andere reaktionäre Mythen, die das oben genannte (und/oder ähnliche) Verhalten unterstützen oder dazu führen.</li>
    <li>Handlungen, die darauf abzielen, diese Instanz oder ihre Leistung zu beschädigen, können zur sofortigen Sperrung des Kontos führen.</li>
    <li>Inhalte, die in Deutschland illegal sind, werden gelöscht und können zur sofortigen Sperrung des Kontos führen.</li>

<p><br>
<h2 id=""best-practices"">Best practices <a href=""#best-practices"">¶</a></h2></p>

<p>Die folgende Liste ist eine Sammlung von Verhaltensweisen, die wir von unseren Nutzern erwarten. Wenn du einen Nutzer siehst, der gegen diese bewährten Praktiken verstößt und dich stört, meldee dies bitte und wir werden mit ihm sprechen.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Nutze generell die zur Verfügung gestellten Mittel, um eine rücksichtsvolle und zugängliche Atmosphäre zu schaffen. Dazu gehört auch die großzügige Verwendung von Inhaltswarnungen (insbesondere bei potenziell beunruhigenden oder kontroversen Themen) und die Verwendung von Untertiteln für Mediendateien.</li>
    <li>Wenn möglich, solltes du in deinen Beiträgen auch andere kreative Arbeiten benennen, die nicht deine eigenen sind.</li>
    <li>Unaufgeforderte Kommentare über die persönlichen Entscheidungen, den Lebensstil oder die Familie eines anderen Nutzers werden nicht geduldet und können als Belästigung angesehen werden. Unangemessene sexuelle Aufmerksamkeit, Kommentare über das Aussehen und die Andeutung von Körperkontakt werden gegenüber einem nicht einwilligenden Nutzer nicht toleriert.</li>
    <li>Wenn du sexuelle oder blutige Inhalte veröffentlichst, verwende Inhaltswarnungen.</li>
    <li>Wenn du Werbung veröffentlichst, solltest du eine Inhaltswarnung verwenden. Die Werbung sollte nicht übertrieben oder automatisiert sein.</li>
    <li>Bots dürfen nur dann mit einem Nutzer interagieren, wenn sie von diesem dazu aufgefordert werden.</li>
    <li>Automatisierte Beiträge und hochfrequente Beiträge sollten <strong>unlisted</strong> (für alle sichtbar gemacht werden, aber nicht in der lokalen Timeline erscheinen), damit die lokale Timeline unserer Instanz ein Ort des Gemeinschaftsdialogs und der menschlichen Interaktion bleibt. Dies gilt auch für Bots, Feed-Poster, Twitter-""Retweets"" und Twitter-Crossposts mit unterbrochenen Erwähnungen. Crossposter-Konten, die sich nicht mehr aktiv an unserer Gemeinschaft beteiligen, können nach dem Ermessen der Moderatoren entfernt werden.</li>
    <li>Bleib in Diskussionen bitte höflich und beleidige deine Gesprächspartner nicht. Beachte, dass Ironie, Sarkasmus oder ähnliche Formen der Sprache sich nicht gut in die Schriftsprache übertragen lassen und dazu neigen, Diskussionen oder Missverständnisse zu eskalieren.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Regeln</h1>

<p>&quot;Be excellent to each other&quot; ist leichter gesagt als getan und bedeutet verschiedene Dinge für verschiedene Menschen.</p>

<p>Die folgenden Regeln sind eine (nicht erschöpfende) Liste von Verhaltensweisen, die nach Ermessen der Instanzadministratoren zur Löschung von Toots, zum Schweigen oder zur Sperrung von Accounts führen können.</p>

<p>Bitte melden Sie Verhalten, das Sie stört. Wir werden Ihren Bericht vertraulich behandeln.</p>

<ul>
<li>Wir tolerieren keine Belästigung, Stalking und Doxxing.</li>
<li>Wir tolerieren keinen Rassismus, Sexismus, verbalen Missbrauch, Diskriminierung von Geschlecht und sexuellen Minderheiten oder die Förderung einer dieser Gruppen.</li>
<li>Wir tolerieren keine gewalttätige nationalistische Propaganda, keine nationalsozialistische Symbolik und keine Förderung der Ideologie des Nationalsozialismus.</li>
<li>Kontaktieren Sie keine Personen, die deutlich gemacht haben, dass sie keinen Kontakt wollen. Dazu gehört auch Dogpiling / Brigading.</li>
<li>Beiträge mit sexuellem Inhalt oder Gore müssen markiert werden.</li>
<li>Werbung muss markiert werden und darf nicht übertrieben oder automatisiert sein.</li>
<li>Automatisierte Beiträge sollten nicht aufgelistet sein (für alle sichtbar machen, aber nicht auf der lokalen Zeitleiste erscheinen), um die lokale Zeitleiste unserer Instanz als Ort des Gemeinschaftsdialogs und der menschlichen Interaktion zu erhalten. Dies gilt auch für Bots, Feedposter, Twitter &quot;retweets&quot; und Twitter-Crossposts mit kaputten Erwähnungen.</li>
<li>Bots dürfen nur dann mit einem Benutzer interagieren, wenn er von diesem dazu aufgefordert wird.</li>
<li>Wenn Sie mit einer hohen Frequenz posten müssen, stellen Sie bitte Ihre Beiträge auf <strong>nicht aufgelistet</strong> ein, um die lokale Zeitleiste lesbar zu halten.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wir pflegen diese Instanz in unserer Freizeit, Hardware und Nerven.</p>

<h1>Rules</h1>

<p>&quot;Be excellent to each other&quot; is easier said than done, and means different things to different people.</p>

<p>The following rules are a (non-exhaustive) list of behaviours that may lead to deletion of toots, silencing or suspension of accounts, at the descretion of the instance administrators.</p>

<p>Please report behaviour that bothers you. We will keep your report confidential.</p>

<ul>
<li>We do not tolerate harrassment, stalking, and doxxing.</li>
<li>We do not tolerate racism, sexism, verbal abuse, discrimination against gender and sexual minorities, or the advocation of any of these.</li>
<li>We do not tolerate violent nationalist propaganda, Nazi symbolism or promoting the ideology of National Socialism.</li>
<li>Do not contact people who made clear they want no contact. This includes dogpiling/brigading.</li>
<li>Posts with sexual content or gore have to be tagged.</li>
<li>Advertisements have to be tagged, and must not be excessive or automated.</li>
<li>Automated posts should be unlisted (rendering visible to everybody, but not appearing on the local timeline) to keep the local timeline of our instance a place of community dialogue and human interaction. This extends to bots, feed posters, Twitter &quot;retweets&quot; and Twitter crossposts with broken mentions.</li>
<li>Bots may only interact with a user when they&#39;re invited by that user to do so.</li>
<li>If you need to post with a high frequency, please set your posts to be <strong>unlisted</strong> to keep the local timeline readable.</li>

We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<h3>Support us</h3>

<p>While <strong>fandom.ink</strong> is a free service, keeping it online costs real world cashmoney. If you have some extra to spare and you&#39;d like to throw it our way to help out, we have <a href=""https://patreon.com/fandomink"">a Patreon</a> for just that purpose!<p></p>

<h2 id=""coc"">Code of conduct</h2>

<h3>Terms of service</h3>

<p>All members of <strong>fandom.ink</strong> agree that they:</p>

<ol style=""margin-bottom: 2em;"">
<li>will abide by the <a href=""https://fandom.ink/terms"">terms of service</a> and <a href=""https://fandom.ink/about/more"">code of conduct</a>, and</li>
<li>are prepared and able to use tools provided by the platform to appropriately curate their own experience, within the constraints described below.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Inappropriate behaviour</h3>

<p><strong>fandom.ink</strong> is a moderated instance. The following behaviours are <em>never</em> tolerated:</p>

<ol style=""margin-bottom: 2em;"">
  <li>the aggressive or contemptuous use of derogatory language, offensive comments, dog-whistles, or the use of slurs related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, (dis)ability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race and ethnicity, religion, or fandom or fannish expression (e.g. ""shipwars"")</li>

  <li>threats of violence</li>
  <li>incitement of violence towards any individual or group, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm</li>
  <li>deliberate intimidation</li>
  <li>sustained disruption of discussion, including the excessive posting of low-value or unrelated content to public timelines (e.g. spam, intentionally disruptive shitposting, etc.)</li>
  <li>religious proselytization</li>
  <li>unwelcome sexual attention, including simulated physical contact</li>
  <li>continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease</li>
  <li>publication of an individual's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information#NIST_definition"">personally identifying information</a> without their consent (""doxxing""), even in situations where that information may be ""public"" in other forums</li>
  <li>the linking of an individual's personas, online handles, screen names, or identities, where those links are not well-known, or where the individual has requested they not be linked</li>
  <li>posting intentionally graphic, shocking, or triggering content without platform-appropriate markings (e.g. CWs, etc.)</li>
  <li>uncut spoilers in public timelines (i.e. spoilers posted without appropriate CWs, etc.)</li>
  <li>commercial accounts or accounts that exist primarily to promote commercial businesses.</li>
  <li>""screenshot dunking"" and/or the reposting of content from locked or otherwise non-public sources, done primarily with the intent of shaming, mocking, or harassing individuals.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id=""18plus"">Adult and erotic content</h3>

<p>Adult/erotic content <strong>is</strong> permitted, under the following caveats:</p>

<ol style=""margin-bottom: 2em;"">
  <li>User avatars and profile banner images <strong>must</strong> be all-ages appropriate.</li>
  <li><em>All</em> adult content must be <strong>clearly marked</strong>, using platform-appropriate tools (e.g. CWs, marking images as ""sensitive"", etc.), including when posted to private or limited-distribution timelines.</li>
  <li>Erotic content (e.g. nudity, ""sensual"" images) is permitted in public timelines, so long as it is clearly marked using platform-appropriate tools.</li>
  <li>Pornographic content (e.g. depictions of actual sex acts) is <strong>not</strong> permitted in public timelines.</li>
  <li>However, linking to erotic or pornographic content (e.g. fic recs, a public buffer/announcement post followed by a thread of unlisted explicit posts, etc.) <em>is</em> permitted in public timelines, with appropriate markings/warnings.</li>
</ol>

<p>In general, <strong>fandom.ink</strong> aims to be a sex-positive experience, with a strong opt-in culture for adult content. Note also that adult content on <strong>fandom.ink</strong> is expected to exist within a primarily fannish context. That is, fanart, fanfic, and so on. Erotica and pornography unrelated to fandom creative works may find a better home on another instance.</p>

<p>Please note that visual depictions of minors in sexual situations are illegal in most jurisdictions, including those in which <strong>fandom.ink</strong> is hosted and operated from. Accordingly, such content is prohibited under the Terms of Service and we do not federate with instances where it is allowed.</p>

<h3>Reposting content</h3>

<p>The reposting of unmodified content from the users of other platforms is prohibited. This includes, but is not necessarily limited to: cross-posted Twitter retweets; reposting art; and reposting unmodified screenshots of posts. Linking to and boosting/""re-tooting"" original works is encouraged instead.</p>

<p>Note that using screenshots of posts as part of, for e.g., art or memes is generally permitted, so long as it does not violate the terms of service or code of conduct (e.g. is not harassing, doxxing, etc.).</p>

<h2>Federation</h2>

<p><strong>fandom.ink</strong> takes a <a href=""http://s.fandom.ink/federation"">proactive stance</a> to managing its federation with other servers. At a high-level, instance moderation policies are designed to attempt to <strong>prioritise and encourage kind, earnest, and authentic connections between individuals</strong> as well as a <strong>culture of consent around content and interactions.</strong></p>

<p>To this end, <a href=""https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/moderation/#suspend-user"">we do not federate</a> with servers that have moderation policies antithetical to ours. These include unmoderated (""free speech"") instances, and any instance that tolerates content that is forbidden under the <strong>fandom.ink</strong> Terms of Service or Code of Conduct.</p>

<p>In addition, large instances and/or instances with a high volume of automated traffic are likely to be <a href=""https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/moderation/#limit-user"">silenced</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that, to preserve the safety of our users and the sanity of our admin, the full blocklist is not publicly available.</p>

<h2>Reporting</h2>

<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, see content you believe violates the code of conduct or terms of service, or have any other concerns, please make use of the platform's in-built flagging and reporting tools, or contact an admin at <a href=""mailto:abuse@fandom.ink"">abuse@fandom.ink</a>. Cases will be responded to as promptly as possible.</p>

<p><strong>fandom.ink</strong> respects confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.</p>

<h2>Consequences</h2>

<p>Participants asked to stop any behaviour deemed inappropriate by a moderator are expected to comply immediately. Individuals continuing to engage in inappropriate behaviours may be shadowbanned or expelled from <strong>fandom.ink</strong>. All decisions by the administrator on this issue are final.</p>

<li>Discrimination against gender and sexual minorities, or advocation thereof</li>
<li>Violent nationalist propaganda, Nazi symbolism or promoting the ideology of National Socialism</li>

<li>Untagged, or automated, or excessive advertisement</li>
<li>sexual content or gore</li>
<li>Bots interacting with users without their explicit requests</li>

<p><br/>
<h2>FR: Code de conduite:</h2>
Pas de spambot, pas de harcèlement ou de drague relou, soyez sympas.
Nous suivons des règles respectant l&#39;inclusion, la modération des contenus faite par des humains, nous réalisons des sauvegardes automatisées, nous communiquons sur les brèches de sécurité, et réalisons de la prévention de harcèlement en bloquant les instances manifestement illicites ou celles réalisant du spam.<br/>
Chaque utilisateur est légalement tenu pour responsable des choses qu&#39;il publie, que ce soit publiquement ou en privé.<br/>
<br/>
Cette instance est généraliste, amicale des personnes LGBT+, régie par la loi française. <br/>
Nous ne supportons pas la publication de contenus racistes, de désinformations diverses (complotisme et pseudo sciences) et modérons les posts contrevenant à nos règles et les spams en tout genre. La liberté d&#39;expression est une chose précieuse, cependant vous devez savoir que cela ne vous permet pas de publier des contenus illégaux ou des appels à la haine (par exemple) sans aucune conséquence.<br/>
Si nos modérateurs et modératrices bénévoles (c&#39;est important) vous soulignent que tel ou tel message est inconvenant ou finissent par vous montrer la sortie parce que vous ne respectez pas les CGU, à aucun moment votre liberté d&#39;expression n&#39;aura été bafouée. Vous pouvez toujours vous exprimer ailleurs, et nous souhaitons garder notre énergie de bénévole (j&#39;insiste), qui est limitée, à meilleur escient. <br/>
Notamment pour passer plus de temps agréable avec des personnes qui respectent les règles.<br/></p>

<p><br/>
L&#39;utilisation de bots est restreinte selon notre bon vouloir.<br/>
Le serveur est hébergé en France et respecte la réglementation RGPD.<br/>
Les médias sexy / not safe for work sont les bienvenus tant qu&#39;ils sont marqués comme tels. Songez à marquer votre compte intégralement en NSFW si vous comptez poster uniquement ce genre de contenus, afin de ne pas avoir à le spécifier manuellement à chaque fois.<br/>
Ces règles sont amenées à évoluer régulièrement selon le consensus des modérateurs et modératrices bénévoles sur cette instance Mastodon.
<br/></p>

<p>Joyeuses conversations!<br/>
N&#39;oubliez pas de rester cordiaux et de lire les contenus des messages avant de les repartager. Prenez soin de débattre sur les arguments sans attaquer les personnes, prenez connaissance de ce qui constitue des arguments fallacieux pour améliorer la qualité des discussions.<br/>
<br/>
Si quelque chose qui ne va pas, envoyez un message privé aux modérateurs et admins, nous seront ravis de pouvoir vous aider.<br/>

<h2>EN: Code of conduct:</h2>

<p>No spambot, no harassment or flirting, just be nice.
We follow rules that respect inclusion, moderation of content by humans, we make automated backups, we communicate about security breaches, and we prevent harassment by blocking obviously illegal or spamming instances.<br/>
Each user is legally responsible for the things he publishes, whether publicly or privately.<br/>
<br/>
This body is generalist, friendly to LGBT+ people, governed by French law. <br/>
We do not support the publication of racist content, misinformation (conspiracy and pseudo-science) and moderate posts that violate our rules and spam of any kind. Freedom of expression is a precious thing, however you should know that this does not allow you to publish illegal content or hate speech (for example) without any consequences.
If our volunteer moderators (this is important) point out to you that this or that message is inappropriate or end up showing you out because you do not respect the TOS, at no time will your freedom of expression have been violated. You can always express yourself elsewhere, and we want to keep our limited volunteer energy (I insist), which is limited, to better use. <br/>
Especially to spend more enjoyable time with people who respect the rules.<br/></p>

<p><br/>
The use of bots is restricted at our discretion.<br/>
The server is hosted in France and complies with the RGPD.<br/> regulation.
Sexy / not safe for work media are welcome as long as they are marked as such. Consider branding your account fully NSFW if you are only going to post this kind of content, so you don&#39;t have to manually specify it every time.<br/>
These rules will evolve regularly according to the consensus of the volunteer moderators on this Mastodon body.
<br/></p>

<p>Happy Conversations!<br/>
Don&#39;t forget to be cordial and to read the contents of the messages before sharing them again. Take care to debate the arguments without attacking people, be aware of what constitutes spurious arguments to improve the quality of the discussions.<br/>
<br/>
If something goes wrong, send a private message to the moderators and admins, we will be happy to help you.<br/></p>

<h3>Kva er Mastodon?</h3>

<p>
Snabelen er ein av mange versjonar av det desentraliserte og fødererte sosiale media nettverket <a href=""https://joinmastodon.org/"">Mastodon</a>. Vi er eit alternativ for dei som ønskjer å være på nettet uta påtrengande reklame, algoritmar og overvåkingskapitalisme.
</p>

<p>
Om begreper som ""desentraliserte og føderererte sosiale medier"" seier deg lite, hald på motet! Du treng ikkje å vite disse tinga for å bruke snabelen.no men om du er nysgjerrig kan du lesa meir om Mastodon <a href=""https://joinmastodon.org/"">her</a>.
</p>

<h3>Detta er eit spleiselag!</h3>

<p>
Bli med å dekke utgiftene for nettverket. Snabelen er ikkje ein bedrift og tenar ikkje pengar på å drive med dette. Faktisk så er det heller ein utgift. En hyggelig utgift. Christoffer dekker alle kostnadene av egen lomme og har gjort det siden starten - med unntak donasjoner frå brukare. Dette er den mest lengstlevende og mest stabile norske heimstaden for Mastodon. Dersom du ønsker å vere med å halde snabelen i gong så kan du bli med på spleise laget på <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/talleraas"">https://www.patreon.com/talleraas</a>.
</p>

<h3>Lurar du på andre norske mastodon heimstader?</h3>

<p>
Snabelen er ikkje det eineste norske mastodon heimstad i Noreg. Mastodon er eit spredt nettverk med masse heimstader som har forskjellige fokus og tilbyr forskjellige ting. Vi prøver å liste eit par av dei.

197,5cb3005c9dfe4526b19b9f16,openbiblio.social,False,1413,"<h2>An wen richtet sich diese Community?</h2>

<ul><li>Diese Instanz bietet allen Kolleg*innen aus deutschsprachigen <i>Bibliotheks- und Informationseinrichtungen</i> einen Startpunkt in das <a href=""https://joinmastodon.org/"">Mastodon-Netzwerk</a>.
<li>Willkommen sind sowohl Vertreter*innen wissenschaftlicher als auch öffentlicher Einrichtungen.
</ul><br><br>

<h2>Warum diese Alternative zu Twitter?</h2> 
<ul><li>Es gibt etliche Gründe, mit der aktuellen Entwicklung von Twitter unzufrieden zu sein. Der zentrale und kommerziell ausgerichtete Dienst tut wenig, um gegen Diskriminierungen aller Art, ""hate speech"" oder ""fake news"" vorzugehen.
<li>Ehemals freie Schnittstellen zu anderen Diensten und Programmen wurden systematisch gekappt, dafür verstärkt Werbung und ein undurchsichtiges Relevanz-Ranking eingeführt.
<li>Viele von unseren Kolleg*innen haben sich ohnehin noch nie mit Twitter anfreunden können: zu anonym, zu groß, zu viel ""Rauschen"". Auf dieser Instanz sind wir – dank des Konzepts der ""lokalen Timeline"" – zunächst einmal unter uns, die Tür in die große weite Welt steht aber immer offen.
<li>Auf dem <a href=""https://openbiblio.social/tags/bibtag19"">#bibtag19</a> hat <a href=""https://openbiblio.social/@rstockm"">Ralf Stockmann</a> einen Vortrag zu diesem Projekt gehalten: <a href=""https://youtu.be/SWe67pmIy0A"">Video</a> | <a href=""http://sbb.berlin/openbiblio"">Folien</a> 
</ul><br><br>

<h2>Erste Schritte</h2> 
<ul><li>Mastodon lässt sich im Web-Browser sowohl auf dem Desktop als auch mobil gut nutzen. Es gibt aber auch eine Reihe guter Apps, mit denen man beispielsweise Notifications gesendet bekommt. Die bekanntesten sind hier zu finden: <a href=""https://joinmastodon.org/apps"">https://joinmastodon.org/apps</a>
<li>Die grundlegenden Konzepte sind sehr ähnlich zu Twitter. Es gibt aber ein paar markante Unterschiede, die einen zivilisierten Gemeinschaftsdialog fördern sollten. Die Besonderheiten sind hier gut dargestellt: <a href=""https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/07/cage-the-mastodon/"">https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/07/cage-the-mastodon</a>
<li>Gesprächspartner*innen entdecken: ein guter erster Startpunkt ist die lokale Timeline. Hier finden sich Leute aus Bibliotheks- und Informationseinrichtungen, die vermutlich ähnliche Interessen haben. Natürlich kann man auch mit Nutzer*innen in Kontakt treten, die sich auf anderen Instanzen als openbiblio.social registriert haben.
<li>Auf dieser Seite finden sich – sobald diese Instanz etwas gewachsen ist - die gerade aktiven Nutzer*innen mit ihren Interessen: <a href=""https://openbiblio.social/explore"">https://openbiblio.social/explore</a> Wenn auch Sie in der Liste erscheinen wollen, um leichter gefunden zu werden, folgen Sie einfach <a href=""https://openbiblio.social/@rstockm/101749670548549211"">dieser Anleitung</a>.

<h2>Wer pflegt diese Community?</h2>
<ul><li>Die Initiator*innen arbeiten an der <a href=""https://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/"">Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin</a>. Die Moderation übernehmen derzeit <a href=""https://openbiblio.social/@hjbove"">Heinz-Jürgen Bove</a>,  <a href=""https://openbiblio.social/@EzellaGarnie"">Gerrit Gragert</a>, <a href=""https://openbiblio.social/@nelsonbusch"">Gudrun Nelson-Busch</a> und <a href=""https://openbiblio.social/@rstockm"">Ralf Stockmann</a>. Dies ist aber explizit als ein offener Dienst für unsere Community gedacht – wir freuen uns über Anfragen, uns bei der Moderation zu unterstützen!
<li>Die Software, auf der diese Instanz aufbaut, ist <a href=""https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon"">open source</a> und wird auf einem Server in Deutschland betrieben. Die Serverwartung garantiert die <a href=""https://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/de/die-staatsbibliothek/abteilungen/idm/"">IT-Abteilung</a> der Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin.

<p><br><br></p>

<h2>Regeln</h2> 

<p>&quot;Seid vorzüglich zueinander&quot; ist einfacher gesagt als getan und bedeutet für verschiedene Menschen unterschiedliche Dinge.
Die folgenden Regeln sind eine (nicht erschöpfende) Liste von Verhaltensweisen, die nach Ermessen der Instanzadministratoren zum Löschen von Toots oder zum Aussetzen von Konten auf dieser Instanz führen können.
<br>
Bitte melden Sie ein Verhalten, das Sie stört. Wir werden Ihren Bericht vertraulich behandeln.
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Wir tolerieren keine Belästigung, Stalking und Doxxing.
<li>Wir tolerieren keinen Rassismus, Sexismus, verbalen Missbrauch, Diskriminierung von Geschlecht und sexuellen Minderheiten oder die Unterstützung eines solchen Verhaltens.
<li>Wir tolerieren keine gewalttätige nationalistische Propaganda, keine Nazi-Symbolik oder die Förderung der Ideologie des Nationalsozialismus.
<li>Wenden Sie sich nicht an Personen, die deutlich gemacht haben, dass sie keinen Kontakt wollen. Dazu gehören auch Dogpiling/Brigading.
<li>Beiträge mit nicht jugendfreiem Inhalt müssen markiert werden
<li>Jobanzeigen können gern gepostet werden. Sie müssen jedoch mit einem Hashtag versehen werden: <a href=""https://openbiblio.social/tags/bibliojobs"">#bibliojobs</a> nach dem gesucht und gefiltert werden kann. Nutzer*innen können das Hashtag jedoch auch muten, um die Timeline auf &quot;echte&quot; Beiträge zu beschränken.
<li>Werbeanzeigen müssen mit dem Hashtag #werbung gekennzeichnet werden und dürfen nicht übermäßig oder automatisiert sein.
<li>Automatisierte Beiträge sollten nicht aufgelistet sein (für alle sichtbar machen, aber nicht auf der lokalen Zeitleiste erscheinen), um die lokale Zeitleiste unserer Instanz als Ort des Gemeinschaftsdialogs und der menschlichen Interaktion zu erhalten. Dies gilt für Bots, Feedposter, Twitter &quot;Retweets&quot; und Twitter-Crossposts mit nicht mehr funktionierenden Erwähnungen.
<li>Bots dürfen nur dann mit einem Benutzer interagieren, wenn sie von diesem Benutzer dazu aufgefordert werden.
<li>Wenn Sie mit hoher Frequenz posten müssen, stellen Sie bitte Ihre Beiträge auf nicht gelistet ein, damit die lokale Timeline lesbar bleibt.
<li>In Diskussionen bleiben Sie bitte höflich, beleidigen Sie nicht die Leute, mit denen Sie sprechen, und setzen Sie Ironie, Sarkasmus oder ähnliche Sprachweisen mit Bedacht ein - sie übersetzen oft nicht gut in die geschriebene Sprache und neigen dazu, Diskussionen oder Missverständnisse zu eskalieren.

198,5cb74534d8bf0e50d9f596a2,mograph.social,False,1257,"<h2>Welcome to mograph.social</h2>

<p>The main purpose of this server is to connect people from the broad motion design community, including VFX artist, animators (more in general designers and artists that are interested in moving images) and to contribute to the Fediverse with interesting content. It is also a place to offer to people in these fields an open space for discussion outside the toxic boxes of mainstream social media.</p>

<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<h3>In general</h3>

<p>Be excellent to each other and respect the rules. </p>

<p>Keep always in mind that the aim of our server is community building and sharing of ideas and interests in respect of each others.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a new member please fill in your profile with the relevant information as soon as you can so we know who we&#39;re talking to, and add a profile picture.
Also it is recommended to make an #introduction post with the appropriate hashtag to tell a bit about yourself and your interests.</p>

<h3>Crossposting</h3>

<p>Crossposting from other networks like Twitter is allowed but if done regularly the posts should be marked as unlisted.
Most importantly the account owner should be active in the conversation on our Mastodon server as well.</p>

<p>If you leave your account alone while crossposting it could be silenced.</p>

<h3>Long threads</h3>

<p>If you plan to post a long thread please post all the messages after the first one as unlisted so you don&#39;t spam the public timelines. Otherwise your account could be silenced.</p>

<h3>Uploading videos</h3>

<p>Due to the nature of our interests we naturally tend to share videos. While doing so please remember that the storage space on the server is not unlimited neither free. We encourage you if possible to upload your content on other platforms of your choice (YouTube, Vimeo, PeerTube, e.g.) and then post them as links here.</p>

<h3>Image descriptions</h3>

<p>Please add an image description for any picture or video you upload so that people on a screen reader can follow along too.</p>

<h3>Advertising and self-promotion</h3>

<p>Mograph.social aims at community building and not at advertising. This space is paid by the community for the community via donations and we can&#39;t accept people using it to do their free advertising campaigns.
It&#39;s considered self-promotion:  showcasing your art, your portfolio and skills, sharing your video tutorials, podcasts, offering/looking for work. 
If you&#39;re here to make a daily advertising campaign of your brand/products with the broadcasting of posts (or threads of posts) into the void, it&#39;s not going to work. Explicit advertising posts with links to direct products/services for sale will be deleted and your account might get silenced. </p>

<p>People, not brands, please.</p>

<h3>Personal Pronouns</h3>

<p>We encourage you to add your pronouns to your profile if you want them to be used and also check your folks profiles for pronouns before engaging in conversation with them.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id=""known-harassers"">Known Harassers:</h3>

<p>The admins may ban or silence users whom we know to be harassers or abusers, even if they have not violated the rules of this instance. The mere presence of a harasser can make past or potential victims uncomfortable, and it can put potential victims who are unaware of the person's history in particular danger. Users are encouraged to individually mute, block, and/or report accounts they don't want to see, but at our discretion, we may take the additional step of blocking or silencing someone instance-wide if we believe they endanger the safe and welcoming space we're trying to maintain.</p>

<h2 id=""reporting"">Reporting</h2>

<p>The current admins are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://romancelandia.club/web/@willaful"">@willaful</a>
<li><a href=""https://romancelandia.club/web/@mom"">@mom</a>
</ul>

<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the admins. They'll respond as promptly as they can.</p>

<p>We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent</p>

<p>We will prioritize marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort, and reserve the right <em>not</em> to act on complaints regarding:</p>

<ul>
<li>""Reverse"" -isms, such as ""reverse racism,"" ""reverse sexism,"" ""cisphobia"", etc.</li>
<li>Users pointing out racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions.</li>
<li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”</li>
<li>Tone policing.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=""consequences"">Consequences</h2>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the admins may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from Romancelandia.Club and identifying the participant publicly as someone about whom we've received complaints.</p>

<p>Be aware that not every user or post you see in your timeline is a member registered at Romancelandia.Club. Users of Romancelandia.Club itself are expected to adhere to this code of conduct, and may expect to be engaged in respectful dialogue with an admin if there is any indication that transgressions were a mistake or lapse. Users from other instances may not feel bound by our CoC terms, but violations from non-local accounts will not receive further grace in moderation decisions.</p>

<h2 id=""best-practices"">Best Practices</h2>

<p>The following aren't hard and fast rules, just suggestions for a
positive community experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Please help keep the community accessible and considerate. In particular, we appreciate alt-text captioning of media files, and the use of content wrappers when a post is likely to be disturbing or triggering for other users.</li>
  <li>Content wrappers are widely used on Mastodon, and seen as a polite consideration when posting on a topic that others might not wish to engage with immediately (for example: ""US election"", ""mental health"", ""bad day, personal"").  Whether to use them in such cases is up to you, but we encourage you to be open to the idea.  We only <em>require</em> content wrappers when a post contains graphic sexual content or gore.</li>
  <li>When possible, please provide credit for creative works in your posts that are not your own.</li>
  <li>Advertisements should not be excessive or automated.</li>
  <li>When promoting your own work, consider the use of a content wrapper, or descriptive hashtags (for example, #Promo, #AuthorPromo, #SelfPromo, #Giveaway, #Sales, etc) so that your post can more easily be found by those who want to see it and avoided by those who don't. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id=""automated-content"">Automated Content</h2>

<ul>
  <li>If posting automated or high-frequency content, please mark it as <strong>unlisted</strong>. This will make it visible to all users, but omit it from the local timeline.</li>
  <li>Bots may only interact with users who've invited them to do so.</li>
  <li>Accounts that only cross-post messages from another service, but never engage as active participants here, may be silenced or removed.</li>
</ul>

<br><br></p>

<p>Mastodon.uno con oltre 71.000 iscritti è la più grande istanza Italiana del <u><a href=""https://mastodon.it"">social mastodon</a></u> e fa parte di un Network federato composto da 14000 siti web: il Fediverso, qua una breve guida al <u><a href=""https://fediverso.it"">fediverso italiano</a></u>. 
Ciò significa che nessun singolo sito controlla l&#39;intera rete, piuttosto, come la posta elettronica, i volontari e le organizzazioni gestiscono i propri siti indipendenti nei quali gli utenti possono interagire tra loro anche se registrati in siti differenti.</p>

<p>Mastodon.uno inoltre gira su server alimentato con energia pulita e green: <br>
<img src=""https://api.thegreenwebfoundation.org/greencheckimage/mastodon.uno?nocache=true"" alt=""This website is hosted Green - checked by thegreenwebfoundation.org""></p>

<p>I siti mastodon vengono chiamati &quot;Istanze&quot; e Mastodon.uno è la prima istanza generalista indirizzata ai soli utenti italofoni all&#39;interno del <u><a href=""https://mastodon.it/it/fediverso"">fediverso</a></u> e rispetta i principi cardine dei social decentralizzati: indipendenti, etici, liberi, gratuiti, senza pubblicità, senza algoritmi che scelgano cosa devi vedere, senza raccolta dati e autogestiti dalla propria community. Qui la nostra <u><a href=""https://noblogo.org/unosocial/carta-dei-valori"">Carta dei valori</a></u>
<br><br></p>

<p>Questa istanza italiana è stata creata dal <a href=""https://devol.it"">gruppo devol</a> per dare uno spazio libero di condivisione e discussione a tutti gli utenti di lingua italiana, e che  <a href=""https://servizi.devol.it"">gestisce oltre 30 servizi online</a> basati sui principi di libertà, riservatezza, federazione e decentralizzazione. Sebbene i messaggi possano anche essere scritti in altre lingue, questa istanza mastodon è riservata esclusivamente ai soli utenti italofoni. Con oltre 10000 utenti attivi è il più grande sito mastodon italiano nel fediverso.</p>

<p><h3>Su Mastodon.uno consigliamo di seguire il manifesto della comunicazione non ostile:</h3><br></p>

<h1>Benvenuti su Mastodon Uno!</h1>

<p>Mastodon &egrave; un social network non commerciale, federato e decentralizzato. Mastodon Uno &egrave; una istanza italiana autogestita dalla community che nasce grazie al lavoro dei Devol.<br />Mastodon.uno &egrave; una istanza generalista in lingua italiana. 
<strong>Attention! This instance is for Italian speakers only!</strong> <br /><br /></p>

<h2>Perch&eacute; iscriversi a Mastodon.uno</h2>

<p>Mastodon.uno &egrave; una <strong>istanza generalista</strong>, indipendente, etica e libera. Vogliamo essere una community felice e benevola, ma anche competente e divertente. Per questo ci siamo dati una policy <strong>rispettosa dei dritti di tutti</strong>, per costruire insieme una community sana e priva di comportamenti tossici.<br />Ti consigliamo di leggere <strong>questo documento</strong> e le <strong><u>regole dell'istanza</u></strong> per capire se Mastodon.uno &egrave; il server che fa per te. Se non ti riconosci o non condividi le regole di questa istanza puoi cercarne un'altra che rispecchi di pi&ugrave; la tua sensibilit&agrave; o i tuoi interessi. In alternativa puoi sempre creare la tua istanza (questo &egrave; il bello di Mastodon) e rimanere collegato all'interno della federazione. <br /><br /></p>

<h2>Mastodon.uno rispetta la tua privacy</h2>

<ul class=""bullet"">
<li>Mastodon <strong>non ti profila</strong> e non vende i tuoi dati personali, perch&eacute; &egrave; indipendente, non ha azionisti, investitori o gruppi/circoli/centri a cui rispondere.</li>
<li>Puoi liberamente decidere il <strong>livello di privacy dei tuoi interventi</strong> all'interno della community (un contenuto pu&ograve; essere: pubblico, pubblico ma non pubblicato nella timeline pubblica, visibile solo ai followers, messaggio privato visibile sono ai destinatari menzionati).</li>
<li>I tuoi <strong>dati personali restano tuoi</strong>, puoi decidere in qualsiasi momento di cancellarli o scaricarne una copia.</li>
<li>I server che gestiscono Mastodon.uno sono all'interno della Comunità Europea.</li>
<li>Mastodon rispetta l'<strong>anonimato</strong>, non ti obbliga ad iscriverti con il tuo nome e cognome o con il tuo numero di telefono, puoi mantenere la tua privacy ed utilizzare qualsiasi nickname&nbsp;</li>
<li>Abbiamo solo bisogno di una tua <strong>email valida</strong> per: la verifica, l'eventuale tuo recupero password, l'invio di eventuali messaggi di servizio da parte dei moderatori. La tua email non viene ceduta o utilizzata per finalit&agrave; diverse.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Mastodon.uno &egrave; un social non-commerciale</h2>

<p>Mastodon &egrave; senza pubblicit&agrave;, senza paywall, senza algoritmi, senza cookies di profilazione. Mastodon <strong>non risponde a logiche commerciali</strong>, non profila n&eacute; rivende dati personali, non usa algoritmi per racchiudere gli utenti in una bolla informativa.<br />I social commerciali centralizzati come facebook e twitter offrono i loro servizi ""gratis"", ma traggono colossali profitti dalla profilazione dei gusti e delle preferenze degli utenti (il prodotto sei tu) e manipolano desideri e comportamenti delle persone (come dimostrato dallo scandalo Cambridge Analytica). Puoi approfondire questo argomento guardando il documentario ""The Social Dilemma"".<br />Mastodon.uno sopravvive solamente grazie alle <strong>donazioni degli utenti</strong>: considera la possibilit&agrave; di dare il tuo contributo!

<h2>Come funziona Mastodon?</h2>
<p>Mastodon &egrave; una piattaforma software open source, libera, decentralizzata e federata. Mastodon &egrave; un'alternativa gratuita alle piattaforme social come Facebook e Twitter.<br />Su Mastodon i messaggi si chiamano ""Toot"" (&egrave; il verso dell'elefantino, simbolo del social) ed in questa istanza &egrave; prevista la lunghezza massima standard di 500 caratteri per ogni toot.<br />I toot possono avere quattro livelli di privacy, liberamente selezionabili dall'utente:</p>

<ul class=""bullet"">
<li>pubblico (pubblicato in timeline pubblica)</li>
<li>pubblico ma non pubblicato nella timeline pubblica</li>
<li>visibile solo ai followers</li>
<li>messaggio privato visibile sono ai destinatari menzionati</li>
</ul>

<p>I toot pubblici potrebbero essere indicizzati sui motori di ricerca. Un ""Boost"" &egrave; l'azione con cui si ridiffonde un toot altrui.<br />I messaggi privati, ovvero i toot leggibili soltanto dagli utenti menzionati, sono conservati in chiaro nel database del sistema; quindi, mentre la loro trasmissione avviene sul web con la protezione del protocollo SSL, essi sono leggibili in chiaro da chi abbia accesso al database.<br />La ""Timeline locale"" presenta i toot dell'istanza Mastodon.uno in ordine cronologico (non ci sono algoritmi che ti suggeriscono contenuti particolari ed ogni toot ha la stessa probabilit&agrave; di essere visto).<br />La ""Timeline federata"" presenta i toot provenienti da molte altre istanze, italiane o internazionali, federate con Mastodon.uno. Non sono presenti tutti i toot di tutte le istanze possibili, nessuna istanza federa veramente tutte le altre.<br />Twitter &egrave; conosciuto come ""Birdsite"".<br />Mastodon permette di formare una rete di nodi collegati tra loro (chiamati ""istanze"") che dialogano fra loro con il protocollo ActivityPub.&nbsp;<br />Mastodon fa parte del network del Fediverso, permettendo ai suoi utenti di sfruttare la struttura federata per interagire anche con utenti su diverse piattaforme aperte che supportano lo stesso protocollo, come PeerTube e Friendica. A differenza dei social commerciali, non c'&egrave; un solo server centrale per Mastodon: ogni istanza ha proprie regole, policy di moderazione, lingua e argomenti preferiti di discussione. E' bene che gli utenti si scelgano l'istanza pi&ugrave; affine alla propria sensibilit&agrave; ed interessi. E' sempre possibile migrare il proprio profilo presso un'altra istanza senza perdere contenuti e followers.<br />Mentre ogni singola istanza &egrave; caratterizzata da una policy che regolamenta in modo specifico la tipologia di contenuti ammessi, il Fediverso, in quanto formato dall'interazione fra istanze federate, &egrave; nel suo complesso pluralista.<br />Per approfondire il funzionamento di Mastodon, &egrave; possibile consultare la guida gratuita in italiano <u>mastodon.it</u>.</p>

<h2>Quando nasce Mastodon?</h2>

<p>Mastodon nasce nel 2016 in Germania per iniziativa del ventiquattrenne Eugen Rochko, per ovviare ai limiti dei social network centralizzati come Twitter ed evitare il rischio che una singola azienda monopolizzi le comunicazioni.<br />L'istanza italiana con un dominio dedicato Mastodon.uno nasce nel 2018 ed entra a far parte della federazione internazionale rappresentando gli utenti di Lingua Italiana. <span data-comment=""comment-deleted"">Mastodon.uno &egrave; un'istanza italiana autogestita ed autofinanziata in Italia, non &egrave; una societ&agrave; e non fa data mining (raccolta, elaborazione e vendita di informazioni personali), siamo presenti su Twitter e su Noblogo.</span> <br /><br /></p>

<h2>Perch&eacute; Mastodon?</h2>

<p><em>Affermare che non si &egrave; interessati al diritto alla privacy perch&eacute; non si ha nulla da nascondere &egrave; come dire che non si &egrave; interessati alla libert&agrave; di parola perch&eacute; non si ha nulla da dire</em>. (Edward Snowden)<br /><span data-comment=""comment-deleted"">Il web &egrave; relegato in giardini recintati e gigantesche server farm che sono nelle mani di poche giganti aziende tecnologiche. I nostri post finiscono nelle bacheche di Facebook e Twitter, soggiogati dai termini di servizio che queste aziende americane impongono. Le foto e i video finiscono su piattaforme come Instagram, Snapchat e YouTube, atolli digitali completamente isolati l&rsquo;uno dall&rsquo;altro. Tutte queste grandi aziende sono impegnate nell'estrarre valore dai nostri contenuti, nel profilarci nel modo pi&ugrave; preciso possibile, in modo tale da influenzare i nostri comportamenti di acquisto, le nostre preferenze politiche, la nostra percezione della realt&agrave;, solo in funzione della <em>loro</em> crescita economica.</span><br /><span data-comment=""comment-deleted"">I social commerciali quindi offrono i loro servizi gratuitamente ma traggono profitti dalla profilazione dei gusti e delle preferenze degli utenti. Questo viene chiamato il ""Capitalismo della sorveglianza"" e la sua accettazione da parte del pubblico attraverso l'argomentazione ""non ho nulla da nascondere"" &egrave; stata ben descritta nel documentario ""Nothing To Hide"".&nbsp;</span><br />Nel documentario<span data-comment=""comment-deleted"">""The Social Dilemma"" viene ben illustrato come l'utilizzo improprio e incontrollato di questi dati porti a un aumento della dipendenza dai social, manipolazione psicologica, formazione di una filter bubble, l'alimentazione della disinformazione.</span><br /><span data-comment=""comment-deleted"">Questa enorme mole di dati pu&ograve; essere messa a disposizione anche di governi (come &egrave; accaduto con lo scandalo di Cambridge Analytica) per orientare facilmente opinioni e comportamenti.</span><br /><span data-comment=""comment-deleted"">Mastodon &egrave; una alternativa open source e free alle piattaforme social come facebook e twitter, una federazione di istanze aperta e decentralizzata chiamata Fediverso.</span><br /><span data-comment=""comment-deleted"">Il Fediverso &egrave; la comunit&agrave; delle community, privo di pubblicit&agrave; e di scopi di lucro, privo di algoritmi di profilazione e modifica comportamentale. Tutte le istanze del Fediverso comunicano fra di loro, senza alcun scopo di lucro e non si appropriano dei dati della nostra vita social, non registrano e non analizzano le nostre relazioni e le nostre comunicazioni.</span><br /><span data-comment=""comment-deleted"">Gli utenti non dipendono da un decisore unico e non sono concentrati e vincolati in una sola propriet&agrave;, ma possono essere liberi di seguire utenti su altri server ed eventualmente essere liberi di migrare verso altre istanze, senza per questo perdere i propri contatti e i contenuti inseriti.&nbsp;</span> <br /><br /></p>

<h1>Termini d'uso dell'istanza Mastodon.uno</h1>

<p><br /><strong>Premessa</strong><br />Mastodon.uno &egrave; una istanza generalista, indipendente, etica e libera. Vogliamo essere una community <span data-comment=""comment-deleted"">felice e gentile, ma anche competente e divertente</span>. Per questo ci siamo dati una <strong>policy rispettosa dei dritti di tutti</strong>, per costruire insieme una community sana e priva di <span data-comment=""comment-deleted"">comportamenti tossici</span>.<br />Ti consigliamo di leggere questa policy e il <a href=""https://mastodon.uno/about/more""><u>manifesto dell'istanza</u></a> per capire se Mastodon.uno &egrave; il server che fa per te. Se non ti riconosci o non condividi le regole di questa istanza puoi cercarne un'altra che rispecchi di pi&ugrave; la tua sensibilit&agrave; o i tuoi interessi. In alternativa puoi sempre creare la tua istanza (questo &egrave; il bello di Mastodon) e rimanere collegato all'interno della federazione.<br />Mastodon.uno vuole rimanere sempre un luogo di incontro, dialogo e confronto con tutti coloro che vorranno apportare contributi rispettando il regolamento dell'istanza.<br /><br /><strong><span data-comment=""comment-deleted"">Netiquette</span></strong><br />Iscriversi in Mastodon.uno significa entrare in una comunit&agrave; dinamica e attiva, valgono per prima cose le regola della buona educazione, dell'ascolto e del rispetto degli utenti presenti. &Egrave; apprezzata la presentazione dei nuovi arrivati.<br />Si raccomanda di segnalare sempre i contenuti che potrebbero mettere in imbarazzo altri utenti con l'<strong>etichetta NSFW</strong> (Not Suitable For Work, non adatto al lavoro) e nascondere il contenuto del toot attivando la <strong>funzione CW</strong> (Content Warning). Si tratta di avvertire gli altri utenti che il contenuto che stanno per visualizzare non &egrave; sempre adatto in tutti i contesti o a tutte le persone.<br />E' buona prassi nascondere il proprio toot con un CW (Content Warning) e un avviso tutto in maiuscolo ""SPOILER ALERT"" quando si sta per fare uno spoiler in modo da avvertire il lettore di proseguire a suo rischio e pericolo. Commettiamo uno spoiler nel momento in cui sveliamo particolari importanti riguardanti un contenuto, per lo pi&ugrave; narrativo, rivelando anticipazioni, svelando colpi di scena o eventi importanti. Pertanto, &egrave; necessario attendere un ragionevole lasso di tempo prima di lasciarsi andare a commenti che potrebbero rovinare la fruizione dei contenuti ad altri utenti. Insomma non pu&ograve; essere considerato spoiler dire che <span data-comment=""comment-deleted"">Renzo e Lucia</span> alla fine si sposano.<br />Quando si desidera mandare a contenuti esterni, preferire ai link Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, i corrispondenti frontend Open come Nitter, Invidious, Bibliogram,Teddit<em>.</em><br /><br /><strong><span data-comment=""comment-deleted"">Linguaggio offensivo e contenuti censurabili</span></strong><br />Mastodon Uno &egrave; una comunit&agrave; in cui ci si diverte e ci si rispetta. La libert&agrave; di espressione &egrave; fondamentale in un web minacciato sempre di pi&ugrave; dalle censure algoritmiche dei social commerciali.<span data-comment=""comment-deleted""> Siamo a favore della libert&agrave; di espressione, attraverso il rispetto della sensibilit&agrave; di tutti. Non siamo tuttavia tolleranti verso chi abusa dell'anonimato.</span> Pertanto, alcuni comportamenti sono vietati in modo assoluto. Su questa istanza:</p>

<ul class=""bullet"">
<li>&egrave; vietata qualsiasi forma di razzismo, sessismo, transfobia, misoginia</li>
<li>&egrave; vietato esprimere o fomentare pregiudizi oppure odio nei confronti di gruppi sociali o etnici</li>
<li>&egrave; vietata qualsiasi forma di intolleranza religiosa</li>
<li>sono vietate foto/video sessualmente esplicite, oppure pornografiche (le foto o rappresentazioni grafiche/artistiche di nudo sono consentite solo con la dicitura NSFW e la protezione CW, Content Warning, attivata)</li>
<li><span data-comment=""comment-deleted"">sono vietate le foto/video o rappresentazioni grafiche/artistiche di nudo, oppure sessualmente esplicite, oppure pornografiche che coinvolgano minori</span></li>
<li><span data-comment=""comment-deleted"">sono vietati contenuti che promuovano un qualsiasi forma fascismo, neofascismo, nazismo, neonazismo, estrema destra, alt-right, negazione dell'Olocausto, anche sotto le mentite spoglie della libert&agrave; di parola</span></li>
<li><span data-comment=""comment-deleted"">sono vietati foto/video o rappresentazioni grafiche/artistiche che ritraggano violenza estrema</span></li>
<li><span data-comment=""comment-deleted"">sono vietati i contenuti pro-ana (promozione di comportamenti legati al disturbo alimentare dell'anoressia nervosa) oppure pro-mia (promozione di comportamenti legati al disturbo alimentare della bulimia nervosa)</span></li>
<li>&egrave; vietato il trolling (provocare e disturbare deliberatamente altri utenti)</li>
<li>&egrave; vietato <span data-comment=""comment-deleted"">offendere, insultare, diffamare o minacciare qualunque persona</span></li>
<li>&egrave; vietata qualsiasi forma di istigazione alla violenza o a commettere reati; &egrave; ugualmente vietata qualsiasi forma di utilizzo dell'istanza Mastodon.uno ai fini di commettere reati. Nel malaugurato caso di reato commesso utilizzando in qualunque forma il server di Mastodon.uno, gli amministratori si comporteranno sulla base delle Leggi vigenti in Italia</li>
</ul>

<p><br /><strong>Account di propaganda partitica e promozione di pratiche religiose, spirituali, pastorali e ascetiche</strong><br />
Mastodon.uno è una community apartititica, laica, aconfessionale e senza scopo di lucro.
<br />
Account con finalità di propaganda partitica (come sezioni di partito, movimenti, liste elettorali) o account religiosi, spirituali ed ascetici non possono essere ospitati.
<br />
Questi account saranno invitati a spostarsi su un&#39;altra istanza da dove potranno essere seguiti.</p>

<p><br /><strong>Fake news e disinformazione</strong><br />Fake news e disinformazione sono problemi sempre pi&ugrave; presenti sul web. Le persone, sempre pi&ugrave; sfiduciate nei confronti di istituzioni e informazione condotta dal giornalismo professionale, scosse dalla discrepanza tra realt&agrave; quotidianamente vissuta e grandi annunci dei media, si sono rifugiate nel buco nero delle teorie paranoidi e spiegazioni cospirazioniste. Questa lettura della realt&agrave;, forse adottata in buona fede e con funzione consolatoria, rischia talvolta di avere conseguenze concrete nella vita o sulla sicurezza delle persone. D'altra parte, le persone rischiano di farsi strumentalizzare per finalit&agrave; politiche o di potere che vanno al dil&agrave; dei contenuti che di volta in volta vengono discussi. Inoltre questo fenomeno ha dato il via alla legittimazione delle velleit&agrave; di censura sul web da parte di isitituzioni governative o statali delle opinioni legittimamente dissonanti, con il pretesto della tutela dei cittadini dalle fake news.<br />Come scovare la disinformazione o la cattiva informazione? E' molto difficile, le falsit&agrave; sono spesso cos&igrave; verosimili o ben congegnate da indurre in errore anche i pi&ugrave; esperti e smaliziati, giornalisti inclusi. Le fake news si diffondono molto velocemente (si calcola che vengano condivise 6 volte pi&ugrave; velocemente delle notizie vere) anche a causa dell'analfabetsismo digitale, ovvero l'impreparazione delle persone nel fronteggiare questo fenomeno. Il giornalismo professionale di questi ultimi anni non si &egrave; rivelato un antidoto contro le frottole, ma una parte del problema, dato che, inseguendo i ritmi dei social network, ingigantisce presunte notizie senza alcun processo di verifica preventiva, per non parlare della propaganda deliberata.<br />In questa istanza non sono ben accetti utenti principalmente impegnati in tutte quelle attivit&agrave; che hanno l'effetto (desiderato o meno) di mettere in discussione in modo fuorviante e aneddotico comportamenti e/o fatti assodati. Ad esempio non sono ben accetti: diffusione di verit&agrave; dubbie o alternative, falsit&agrave;, prove aneddotiche, false citazioni, false conferme o citazioni circolari, contenuti che provocano shock, teorie cospirative, trame oscure, disinformazione, sensazionalismo, propaganda, dicerie, bufale, leggende urbane, pseudoscienza.<br />E' una regola basilare quella di non pubblicare contenuti inesatti, imprecisi o falsi. Quando si condivide un'informazione &egrave; importante essere certi del grado di veridicit&agrave; ed &egrave; buona norma citare la fonte della notizia. Il fenomeno delle bufale trova infatti il suo ossigeno proprio nella condivisione selvaggia di una notizia priva di fondamento da parte di utenti che si lasciano colpire emotivamente senza farsi troppe domande, oppure sono troppo pigri per verificare, anche solo cercando velocemente sui motori di ricerca.<br /><br /><strong>Account verificati</strong><br />La promozione di contenuti creati dall'utente e l'uso di mastodon a scopi autopromozionali non commerciali &egrave; consentita solo per i contenuti appartenenti all'utente, mentre &egrave; vietato promuovere contenuti di terze parti. Per assicurare la promozione di contenuti propri &egrave; necessario effettuare la verifica dell'account.<br />Per verificare il proprio account, &egrave; sufficiente inserire lo script (che si trova nel proprio pannello di modifica del profilo utente - Profilo &gt; Modifica profilo &gt; Verifica) all'interno della home page del proprio sito web. <span data-comment=""comment-deleted"">In alternativa, &egrave; possibile verificare il proprio account con la app open source <strong>keybase</strong> per verificare la propria identit&agrave; su pi&ugrave; social: keybase su Mastodon.uno. Invitiamo tutti quindi a verificare il proprio account personale con il proprio sito web.</span><br />L'uso di bot &egrave; consentito, ma &egrave; necessario impostare l'account come bot ed essere verificati. E' possibile inserire link per chiedere donazioni solo da account verificati.&nbsp;<br />&Egrave; apprezzato da parte della comunit&agrave; che l'utente intenzionato a promuovere un proprio spazio partecipi attivamente alle attivit&agrave; di Mastodon.uno.<br /><br /><strong>Spam e flooding</strong><br />Sono vietati spamming (invio di messaggi pubblicitari) e flooding (invio di grande quantit&agrave; di messaggi), la creazione di account multipli da parte della stessa persona, topic e/o <span data-comment=""comment-deleted"">risposte multiple sullo stesso argomento</span>.<br /><br /><strong>Paywall, promo servizi a pagamento e link di affiliazione</strong><br />&Egrave; vietato postare link a siti che richiedano la registrazione o il pagamento per accedere ai contenuti.<br />&Egrave; vietato postare link a pagine che propongono prodotti o servizi a pagamento.<br />&Egrave; vietato postare link contenenti codice di affiliazione (referral link o revenue link), ovvero quei link che tracciano il comportamento dell'utente ricompensando con un bonus chi a pubblicato il link.<br />E' vietato postare contenuti che promuovono il gioco d'azzardo, scommesse o giochi con denaro in genere.<br /><br /><strong>Et&agrave; minima per l'iscrizione</strong><br />Iscrivendoti all'istanza Mastodon.uno, dichiari <span data-comment=""comment-deleted"">di aver compiuto almeno i <strong>16 anni di et&agrave;</strong></span>.<br /><br /><strong>Privacy nei contenuti postati</strong><br />&Egrave; vietato postare informazioni personali, screenshot di conversazioni private o link a pagine personali su altri social network: l'anonimato degli utenti e delle persone va rispettato.<br /><br /><strong>Moderazione dei contenuti</strong><br />I moderatori dell'istanza, in caso di violazione della policy dell'istanza, si riservano di:</p>

<ul class=""bullet"">
<li>entrare nel merito della discussione contestando uno o pi&ugrave; aspetti delle argomentazioni o richiedendo spiegazioni, non diversamente da quanto pu&ograve; fare qualsiasi utente non moderatore (tanto dissenso significa che l'istanza non apprezza)</li>
<li>avvertire esplicitamente un utente con un messaggio pubblico oppure privato, specificando la violazione di policy e la richiesta dei moderatori (come ad esempio: cancellare un toot, cambiare la modalit&agrave; o i contenuti futuri, invito a trasferirsi su una istanza pi&ugrave; idonea ai contenuti/metodo dell'utente)</li>
<li>in caso di mancata risposta o interlocuzione con i moderatori, un utente pu&ograve; venire silenziato, misura che non lo far&agrave; pi&ugrave; apparire in timeline pubblica</li>
<li>in caso continue violazioni della policy e mancata risposta o interlocuzione con i moderatori, un utente pu&ograve; essere bloccato, misura che ne cancella tutti i contenuti e l'account senza possibilit&agrave; di recupero</li>
</ul>

<p><br /><strong>Risoluzione delle controversie</strong><br />In caso di disaccordo in relazione all'intervento di un moderatore, l'utente pu&ograve; sottoporre le sue ragioni agli amministratori del sistema: @filippodb e @devol. Il giudizio degli amministratori &egrave; definitivo e inappellabile. In caso di controversie, &egrave; bene tuttavia che gli utenti considerino il fatto che c'&egrave; sempre la possibilit&agrave; di scegliere un'istanza pi&ugrave; affine alla propria sensibilit&agrave; ed interessi. E' sempre possibile migrare il proprio profilo presso un'altra istanza senza perdere contenuti e followers.</p>

<h3>Personen hinter da*.social</h3>

<p>Hallo. Mein Name ist Alex. Ich bin Unternehmensgründer aus Darmstadt und verfächter von freier Software und freiem Social Media. Ich betreibe diese Instanz in meiner Freizeit als Darmstädter für andere Darmstädter.</p>

<p>Ich stehe im Kontakt zu anderen Hobby-Administratoren in ganz Deutschland um ein gesundes Netzwerk alternativer Social Media aufzubauen.</p>

<p>Meine Grundidee ist es, eine Plattform für Darmstädter zu bieten auf der lokal-relevante Themen geteilt werden können. Durch die Architektur der Plattform, ist auch eine Kommunikation über Landes und Bundesgrenzen hinaus möglich. Meine Hoffnung an dieses Projekt ist, Menschen, Vereine, Verwaltung, lokale Bewegungen und Gruppen jeglicher Art zusammen zu bringen.</p>

<p>Durch meine Erfahrung als CTO und System Administrator hoffe ich eine stabile Plattform betreiben zu können. Mittelfristig werde ich mit öffentlichen Institutionen wie der hda und TU Darmstadt kooperieren, um der Plattform gerecht bleiben zu können. Nichts desto trotz handelt es sich um ein Hobby-Projekt, weswegen ich keine Gewährleistungen geben kann. Dagegen kann ich Transparenz und pro-aktive Maßnahmen bieten und diese für mich sprechen lassen.</p>

<p>Verbesserungsvorschläge nehme ich gerne an und Diskussionen stehe ich offen gegenüber. Schickt mir einfach eine Mail an <a href=""mailto:info@darmstadt.social"">info@darmstadt.social</a>.</p>

<h3>Einstellen des Dienstes</h3>

<p>Die Betreiber dieser Instanz behalten sich das Recht vor diesen Dienst jederzeit einzustellen. Nach bekanntgabe bleiben fairerweise noch 3 Monate um etwaige Daten zu sichern und einen Account-Umzug durchzuführen.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id=""aviso-de-conteudo"">Política de aviso de conteúdo (CW)</h3>

<p>O Mastodon possui uma funcionalidade chamada de ""aviso de conteúdo"", em inglês “content warning” ou “CW”.</p>

<p>O uso de aviso de conteúdo é <em>obrigatorio</em> em postagens que:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mencionam assuntos traumáticos (por exemplo: abuso, estupro, violência).</li>
<li>Contenham enredo de séries, jogos e filmes (por exemplo: ""Spoilers de Power Rangers S01E01"").</li>
<li>Contenham nudez, conteúdo sexual e imagens de violência (mesmo que em representações artísticas).</li>
<li>Descrições explícitas de sexo ou conteúdo sexual em postagens públicas.</li>
<li>Vídeos com movimentos rápidos e luzes intermitentes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Temas que o uso do aviso de conteúdo é de bom tom e deixa todo mundo feliz:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Futebol</li>
<li>Política</li>
<li>Distúrbios mentais</li>
<li>Distúrbios alimentares</li>
<li>Relacionamentos abusivos</li>
<li>Comida</li>
<li>Álcool, cigarro e outras drogas</li>
<li>Aranhas, répteis e outras coisas que podem causar desconforto em pessoas que possuem fobias</li>
<li>Retratos de si, principalmente aquelas com contato visual direto</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=""sobre-crossposters"">Sobre Crossposters</h2>

<p>Crossposters são ferramentas, automatizadas ou não, usadas para postar a partir de outras redes (como Twitter ou Tumblr) para o Mastodon. O uso destas ferramentas é permitido, mas as seguintes regras se aplicam:</p>

<ul>
<li>Não podem ser postados com privacidade pública.</li>
<li>Posts vindos de outras redes, como o Twitter, ainda precisam obedecer à outras regras desse código, tais como avisos de conteúdo.</li>
<li>Só podem ser usados na condição de que você acompanha as suas notificações, do contrário resultará em suspensão após uma advertência.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=""sobre-niveis-de-privacidade"">Sobre níveis de privacidade</h2>

<p>No Mastodon cada status pode ser postado em quatro diferentes configurações de audiência. É importante ter isso em mente porque certas regras só se aplicam a determinadas configurações:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Pública:</em> A publicação é enviada para as timelines local e global/federada, compartilhadas por outros membros da instância, é enviada para todos os seguidores, aparece na página pública de perfil da pessoa que postou, aparece em buscas por hashtags.</li>
<li><em>Não listada:</em> A publicação é enviada para todos os seguidores, aparece na página pública de perfil da pessoa que postou, não aparece em buscas por hashtags e não aparece em timelines local ou global/federada.</li>
<li><em>Privada</em> (""Followers only""): A publicação é enviada apenas para os seguidores.</li>
<li><em>Direta:</em> A publicação é enviada apenas para os usuários mencionados.</li>
</ul>

<h4>🚨 IMPORTANTE 🚨</h4>

<p>No Mastodon <em>nenhum post, incluindo mensagens diretas (DM), é criptografado de ponta-a-ponta (""end-to-end encryption"", ou ""E2EE"")</em>. Para mensagens sensíveis, que necessitam de maior privacidade, recomendamos o uso de messenger criptografado de ponta-a-ponta como o <a href=""https://signal.org/pt_BR/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Signal</a>.</p>

<h2 id=""como-reportar-violacao"">Como reportar uma violação do código de conduta</h2>

<p>Qualquer post ou perfil, mesmo de outra instância  que você acredite que esteja em violação dessas regras pode ser denunciado utilizando a ferramenta interna do Mastodon e ele será enviado aos moderadores.</p>

<p>Você pode fazer uma denúncia mesmo que a sua situação não seja diretamente coberta por essas regras, caso a situação lhe cause desconforto. A moderação irá avaliar cada situação individualmente.</p>

<p>Caso a sua denúncia seja relativa a um dos moderadores, você pode reportar a violação através de mensagem direta à um dos outros moderadores.</p>

<p>Fazemos um esforço para que as denúncias sejam processadas em até 24 horas, mas somos pessoas com vidas fora do Mastodon e eventualmente pode demorar um pouco mais.</p>

<h2 id=""inatividade"">Inatividade</h2>

<p>Contas inativas por mais de um ano estão sujeitas a serem removidas da plataforma. Enviaremos um aviso alguns dias antes, dando a possibilidade que a pessoa possa manter a conta.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Chi siamo</strong></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Siamo un gruppo di lavoro di musicisti, appassionati di musica. Facciamo parte di centri sociali, esperienze sociali autogestite. Ci siamo ritrovati a dare vita a questo progetto grazie al contatto e supporto con alcuni attivisti del collettivo Bida gi&agrave; creatori dell&rsquo;istanza &ldquo;mastodon.bida.im&rdquo;.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /><br /></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><strong>Perch&egrave; una istanza focalizzata sulla musica?</strong><br /><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Stanchi di scambiarci informazioni tramite sistemi eticamente in contrasto con i nostri principi, abbiamo deciso di dar vita a questa istanza.<br />
Siamo convinti che slegare la diffusione di musica da logiche competitive, possa favorire il fare comunità, quindi un maggiore e più sincero scambio di informazioni.</span><br />
Siamo per incentivare l'autoproduzione (DIY) e l'autogestione, riprendere il controllo dei nostri strumenti quotidiani, imparare a conoscerli e non esserne assoggettati.<br />
Siamo per la decentralizzazione e non per l'accumulazione di potere in pochi sistemi. Piccolo è bello ed il sistema federato e decentrato di Mastodon aiuta in questo.<br />
Questa istanza non vuole essere un semplice luogo di discussione sulla musica scollegato dal contesto, ma un punto d'incontro che stimoli anche una crescita con un confronto continuo sulle metodologie utilizzate, sia in questo spazio che al di fuori di esso.<br \>
Crediamo appunto, che le connessioni che influenzano la diffusione e la creazione di determinata musica siano molteplici e noi tutte/i possiamo partecipare nella definizione di questo.

</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>Premessa</strong></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Intendendo social network come strumento di comunicazione riconosciamo che negli ultimi anni le soluzioni commerciali (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter ecc) hanno acquisito un ruolo preponderante per quanto riguarda il modo di comunicare in rete. Siamo nella situazione in cui parlare di Social Network significa solo identificare i social network commerciali. Profilazione di massa, gamificazione, manipolazione delle informazioni e impossibilit&agrave; della gestione dei propri contenuti sono solo gli elementi problematici maggiormente visibili.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Gli attori principali sono in questo campo solo multinazionali che con le loro piattaforme hanno affinato meccanismi che, fondandosi su alcuni concetti sviluppatisi nell'ambito della psicologia cognitiva, spingono l'utente a una sempre maggiore permanenza al loro interno. Parallelamente, per legare ancora di pi&ugrave; gli utenti a s&eacute;, hanno sollecitato un accentramento delle informazioni creando una sorta di bolla che ha in parte raggiunto il loro obiettivo di accentrare tutte le informazioni di cui un utente ""ha bisogno"" quotidianamente.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Questi social network con le loro strategie hanno pesantemente modificato le relazioni sociali. Nonostante questo crediamo sia possibile utilizzare strumenti analoghi ma di cui siamo in controllo e il cui funzionamento possiamo decidere collettivamente, allo scopo ad esempio di poter condividere informazioni e discuterle assieme.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Crediamo che i movimenti sociali non sono stati capaci di proporre una piattaforma finalizzata all'open publishing non commerciale. Crediamo ovviamente che il motivo non sia la mancanza di capacit&agrave; tecniche, ma (forse) la sfiducia sull'utilit&agrave; di un Social Network, sui danni provocati dal suo utilizzo eccessivo, sull'impossibilit&agrave; di poter competere con la massa degli utenti dei social network commerciali ed il rischio di divenater strumenti di nicchia facilmente attaccabili.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Tuttavia crediamo che una risposta possibile che si pu&ograve; dare nell'immediato al monopolio incontrastato dei social network commerciali sia tentare strade alternative capaci di creare delle emorragie di utenti e contenuti, con la volont&agrave; di non renderli pi&ugrave; l'unico punto in cui trovare la maggior parte delle informazioni che ci interessano.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /><br /></span></p>

<p><strong>Qual &egrave; la nostra idea di ""social network""</strong></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Troviamo che le piattaforme e i gruppi capaci di gestire un server o servizi autogestiti siano una ricchezza per tutto il movimento e che tali infrastrutture debbano essere incentivate nel modo pi&ugrave; decentralizzato e federato possibile.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Troviamo che la formazione e l'autoformazione siano indispensibili e possibili solo con il coinvolgimento di tutt* anche nella gestione di una infrastruttura informatica.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Troviamo che, per la nostra attivit&agrave; e per la libert&agrave; di tutte e tutti, l'anonimato sia da difendere.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Crediamo che sia importante che esista un mezzo capace di permettere, anche a chi ha poche competenze tecniche, di potersi esprimere senza che qualcuno lo possa facilmente identificare.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cosa vogliamo nel nostro social network</strong></p>

<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Poter conoscere gli algoritmi che definiscono i contenuti che appaiono nella nostra &ldquo;home&rdquo;. Quindi un Social Network trasparente, appunto Open Source.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Gestire la piattaforma nel modo più orizzontale possibile tramite assemblee e altre tecniche legate al <a href=""https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metodo_del_consenso"">metodo del consenso</a>.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Poter incentivare lo scambio di informazioni utili alla nostra crescita personale e scoraggiare appunto l&rsquo;opposto.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Poter avere un aggregatore, in cui ricercare facilmente le notizie che ci interessano.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Poter controllare facilmente i nostri contenuti e distruggerli con un semplice click.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Poter parlare e dialogare con gli/le admins del server su cui postiamo i nostri contenuti.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Poter accedere a notizie nel modo pi&ugrave; anonimizzato possibile.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Poter generare kaos, avere tantissime identita' diverse.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Poterci trovare in una comunit&agrave; con cui dialogare anche dal vivo e non solo attraverso un computer.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Costruire un'alternativa ai social network commerciali,</strong></p>

<p><strong>Perch&eacute; Mastodon</strong></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mastodon &egrave; attualmente il miglior candidato su cui concentrare le nostre energie. Mastodon &egrave; un social network distribuito, federabile, simile a Twitter, ma amministrato in modo decentralizzato. Ogni server (o ""instance"") mantiene la propria autonomia e dialoga con altre instance attraverso gli standard aperti Ostatus (usato anche da GNU Social) e ActivityPub.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vorremmo far vivere Mastodon principalmente come uno spazio di ""rimbalzo"" verso altri Blog/Siti/Forum e non come un contenitore di contenuti. Ogni instance di mastodon rappresenta un'isola dove gli/le utent* condividono degli interessi e una policy di comportamento.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cosa contraddistingue questa istanza di mastodon</strong></p>

<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">tutela della privacy e dell'anonimato: non pubblichiamo n&eacute; conserviamo dati sensibili di alcuna persona (anche se presenti in altri siti)</span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cosa non si puo' fare su questa istanza</strong></p>

<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Postare messaggi razzisti, sessisti, fascisti, violenti verso le singole persone.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Postare messaggi di propaganda partitica istituzionale</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Postare messaggi finalizzati esclusivamente alla promozione di attivit&agrave; commerciali</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Postare messaggi offensivi e denigratori, finalizzati al semplice insulto o alla minaccia personale nei confronti di altri utenti</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Postare messaggi che facciano riferimento a contenuti di facebook: ti invitiamo invece ad aprire anche un blog</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Postare messaggi senza considerare che gli utenti possono avere una sensibilita' diversa dalla tua (utilizza il content warning)</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Postare messaggi del tipo ""se mi segui, ti seguirò anche io"", ""seguimi anche tu perfavore"", o similari. Questa istanza non vuole creare dinamiche di questo tipo.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cosa mastodon non pu&ograve; fare</strong></p>

<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Renderti assolutamente ""anonimo""</span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Caratteristiche interessanti di mastodon</strong></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mastodon presenta delle caratteristiche che permettono di mitigare gli effetti degli strumenti di profilazione di massa e della Social Media Intelligence</span></p>

<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>decentralizzato e federato</strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">: il funzionamento di mastodon permette di avere diversi nodi autonomi e collegati tra loro. Questo nodo mette la privacy degli utenti al primo posto: i tuoi dati non vengono conservati</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>identit&agrave; multiple:</strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> creandoti identit&agrave; multiple puoi creare ""dissonanze"" nei modelli statistici che analizzano i comportamenti delle persone sui social media</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>diritto all'oblio:</strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> cancella il tuo utente, cancella i tuoi contenuti, elimina la tua ""impronta"" dal nodo</span></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">D'altronde la soluzione per essere anonimi non pu&ograve; essere solo tecnica: le nostre interazioni, le nostre reti sociali reali, sono dati e indicatori di chi siamo. Agenzie governative e aziende possono arrivare a capire ""chi siamo"" con buona approssimazione anche se usiamo un nickname e ci colleghiamo tramite TOR, a partire dalle interazioni pubbliche online.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Queste sono possibilit&agrave; che devi quindi prendere in considerazione quando usi la nostra piattaforma:</span></p>

<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">i messaggi che scrivi possono avere ricadute repressive sugli admin e sull'esistenza del nodo stesso</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">certi comportamenti possono rilevare la tua identita' e quella degli/lle altr* utent* (per questo fai piu' utenze, generando chaos!)</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">gli admin sono impegnati a garantirti un'esperienza sicura ma la sicurezza assoluta non esiste. Per questo &egrave; importante mettere in campo pratiche per rendersi anonimi a seconda delle situazioni, ad esempio usando tor.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mastodon come qualunque altra soluzione unicamente tecnica non pu&ograve; essere la soluzione: le soluzioni si trovano e costruiscono a partire e all'interno delle realt&agrave;/gruppi/esperienze dai legami e dalle interazioni tra le persone che ne fanno parte.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>

<p><strong>Come si gestisce il nodo stereodon.social? Come e quando gli/le utent* possono dialogare con gli/le admins</strong></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Il nodo viene gestito attraverso l'impegno di un gruppo di lavoro composto da sysadmin, amministratori e moderatori. Non si tratta di una redazione, non abbiamo linee editoriali da proporre. Il gruppo che gestisce il nodo si impegna a tenere in vita il nodo nel rispetto della policy.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Gli utenti possono facilmente dialogare con il gruppo di lavoro attraverso la messaggistica privata o via la mail, avvisando gli admins e i moderatori di violazioni della policy.</span></p>

<p><strong>Vorremo creare una nostra instance, come possiamo fare?</strong></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Il gruppo di lavoro che sta dietro a stereodon.social &egrave; nato grazie al supporto del collettivo hacklabbo e Bida, ogni tanto creano degli incontri per aiutare la nascita di nuove istanze. Contattateli!</span></p>

<p><strong>Siamo un gruppo e siamo solo su facebook, come possiamo pubblicare i nostri contenuti?</strong></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Semplicissimo, riportate anche da noi i contenuti senza inserire link da facebook con il testo (se rientra nei 500 caratteri) o uno screenshot. Oppure a apritevi un blog su Noblogs ed utilizzare il plugin Mastodon Autopost per pubblicare automaticamente su Stereodon. Avere un blog/sito autonomo e non dipendere solo da facebook e' una ricchezza per tutt*. Questo progetto nasce anche per incentivare l'autonomia dalle multinazionali dell'IT.</span></p>

Spanish is preferred, but all languages are welcome.</p>

<h1>Código de conducta</h1>

<p><em>Version 4</em></p>

<p>En general asumimos que somos todos adultos responsables con la ""piel dura"". Es decir que estamos preparados para recibir opiniones tan suaves o tan duras como las que emitimos. Tambien asumimos que hay una intención de divertirse e informarse sin generar un ambiente hostil.</p>

<p>Esta instancia se regirá por este código de conducta. Resumidas en estas reglas:</p>

<p>1. Todos los comentarios son personales. Las textos y opiniones escritos son responsabilidad del autor. Esta instancia, sus administradores y moderadores no avalan ninguna de las opiniones publicadas.</p>

<p>2. La instancia, sus administradores y moderadores no apoya fachistas o nazis. Tampoco apoya sus expresiones ni sus ataques contra minorías. Esto no es Gab.</p>

<p>3. Mantenegamos todos un tono relativamente civilizado.</p>

<p>4. Recordemos que del otro lado hay una persona con sentimientos. No destratar innecesariamente. </p>

<p>5. No publiquemos datos privados de otros miembros de la instancia. Esto incluye capturas de pantalla de sus mensajes.</p>

<p>6. La pornografía infantil esta prohibida y es ilegal! Será considerada pornografía infantil todo mensaje o imagen donde se combine sexualidad con imágenes de menores de 18 años. Si un mensaje o foto o pintura combina niños o menores de 18 años en un contexto sexual de cualquier tipo sin importar lo sutil o indirecto que sea, mejor no la publiques. Cualquier insinuación de pornografía infantil será reportada rápidamente al FBI junto con todos los datos colectados.</p>

<p>7 Para participar, debes ser mayor de edad (18 años).</p>

<p>8 Los datos y contenidos no se venden ni comercializan.</p>

<p>9 Protegemos la información y mantenemos la instancia segura aplicando las últimos parches y actualizaciones. Es un esfuerzo constante. Sin embargo, puede ocurrir que, a pesar de nuestros esfuerzos, alguien hackee uno o varios servidores. Tengase presente antes de enviar cualquier información considerada sensible.</p>

<p>10 Como parte de nuestra labor, mantenemos copias de respaldo de todos los datos en la instancia. De ser necesario, restauraremos todos los datos con la última copia de respaldo disponible. Puede, sin embargo, ocurrir que algunos toots se pierdan. Todos aceptaremos la pérdida, incluso si es irreparable, con tristeza y resignación, y luego, seguiremos con nuestras vidas.</p>

<p>11 Almacenamos cierta información, como el correo electrónico, la IP de origen y algunas cosas mas, necesarias para el funcionamiento del sistema. Tambien almacenamos la información provista por los usuarios y los toots :-)
Si decides usar esta instancia, implica que aceptas y nos autorizas a hacerlo.</p>

<p>12 Esta instancia usa varias tecnologías y servicios necesarios para su funcionamiento. Una lista incompleta incluye: proveedores de servicios DNS, hosting, S3, CDN y defensas contra DDOS y otros tipos de ataques informáticos. La información puede circular por estos servicios que son externos a la instancia.
El solo hecho de usar esta instancia implica que autorizas todas estas operaciones sobre los datos.</p>

<p>13 Las cuentas se pueden borrar y la información purgar como se explica en los manuales de usuario de mastodon. Cada usuario es responsable de llevar adelante estas operaciones cuando mejor le convenga (si quiere). No es una tarea de los moderadores hacer este tipo de limpiezas.</p>

<p>14 A veces (pocas), un administrador o moderador esconderá un toot, o lo borrará, o suspenderá a un usuario por violaciones evidentes a este código de conducta. Esas decisiones se pueden apelar una vez al mismo moderador o a otro. Despues de lo cual la decisión es final.</p>

<p>15 Cada tanto revisaremos este código de conducta. Estamos abiertos a sugerencias y cambios. Por favor, escriban sus aportes en toots.</p>

<p>    - La Administración.</p>

<h1>Code of conduct</h1>

<p><em>Version 4</em></p>

<p>In general we assume that we are all responsible adults with ""hard skin"". In other words, we are prepared to receive opinions as soft or as hard as those we issue. We also assume that there is an intention to have fun and learn without creating a hostile environment.</p>

<p>This instance will be governed by this code of conduct. Summarized in these rules:</p>

<p>1. All comments are personal. Written texts and opinions are the responsibility of the author. This instance, its administrators and moderators do not endorse any of the opinions published.</p>

<p>2. This instance, its admins and moderators do not support fascism or nazis. we do not support their expressions and attacks against minorities. This is not Gab.</p>

<p>3. Let's all keep a relatively civil tone.</p>

<p>4. Remember that on the other side there is a person with feelings. Do not weed out unnecessarily.</p>

<p>5. We do not publish private data of other members of the instance, including screenshots.</p>

<p>6. Child pornography is prohibited and illegal! Any message or image that combines sexuality with images of children under 18 years of age will be classified as child pornography. If a message or photo or painting combines children or those under 18 years of age in a sexual context of any kind, no matter how subtle or indirect it is, you better not post it. Any hints of child pornography will be promptly reported to the FBI along with all the data collected.</p>

<p>7. To participate, you must be of legal age (18 years).</p>

<p>8. The data and content are not sold or commercialized.</p>

<p>9. We protect the information and keep the instance secure by applying the latest patches and updates. It is a constant effort. However, it may happen that, despite our efforts, someone hacks one or more servers. Please be aware before submitting any information deemed sensitive.</p>

<p>10. As part of our work, we keep backup copies of all data in the instance. If necessary, we will restore all data with the latest available backup copy. It may, however, happen that some toots are lost. We will all accept the loss, even if it is irreparable, with sadness and resignation, and then we will continue with our lives.</p>

<p>11. We store certain information, such as email, source IP and some other things, necessary for the operation of the system. We also store the information provided by users and toots :-)
If you decide to use this instance, it implies that you accept and authorize us to do so.</p>

<p>12. This instance uses various technologies and services necessary for its operation. An incomplete list includes: DNS, hosting, S3, CDN service providers and defenses against DDOS and other types of computer attacks. Information can circulate through these services that are external to the instance.
Just using this instance implies that you authorize all these operations on the data.</p>

<p>13. Accounts can be deleted and information can be purged as explained in the mastodon user manuals. Each user is responsible for carrying out these operations when it is best for them (if they want). It is not a task of the moderators to do this type of cleaning.</p>

<p>14. Sometimes (few), an administrator or moderator will hide a toot, delete it, or suspend a user for obvious violations of this code of conduct. Those decisions can be appealed once to the same moderator or to another. After which the decision is final.</p>

<p>15. We will review this code of conduct from time to time. We are open to suggestions and changes. Please write your contributions in toots.</p>

<p>This is a Fediverse/Mastodon instance for climate justice activists and everybody who feels they belong to the climatejustice movement and follows our rules and principles as described below.</p>

<h3><font size=""6.5"">WHO WE ARE</font></h3>

<p>&quot;We&quot; is currently basically just Paula (@PaulaToThePeople@climatejustice.social), who owns the server.<br>
It is hosted locally in Vienna, Austria via the Fediverse Foundation.
The server is NOT officially part of the Fediverse Foundation though.<br>
Paula will try and found a new club to have a legal structure responsible for this server. If you want to join, holler!</p>

<h3><font size=""6.5"">DONATIONS</font></h3>

<p>The usage of the server is free and will always remain free, unless something completely unforeseen happens (it won&#39;t!).<br>
But the server costs money, which Paula pays out of her own pocket.
To support her please donate to:</p>

<h3><font size=""6.5"">PRINCIPLES</font></h3>

<h3><font size=""4"">We stand for climate justice, which includes justice for all marginalized people as well as other living beings and we stand against discrimination and exploitation.</font></h3>

<p>We are allies to disabled people, queer and lgbtqia* people, BIPoC, women, poor people, kids and future generations as well as other vulnerable groups including animals, plants and all living beings. We might be critical to religion in general, but stand up against antisemitism, islamomisia and other forms of discrimination due to religious background.
We acknowledge our own privileges and work on our own unintentionally discriminatory behaviors. We are all part of an exploitative system and it&#39;s impossible to live within that system without harming anyone. We are aware of that and try to work against it, but we are not all fossil free and vegan and that&#39;s okay. We don&#39;t exclusively post about climate justice, but at least some of our posts should be about climate justice.</p>

<h3><font size=""4"">We consider ourselves on the left side of the political spectrum and stand up against right wing ideologies.</font></h3>

<p>We have different political views, but are all on the left side or at least are left-open, but right-closed centrists. We stand together against capitalism and fascism and even if we disagree on important issues we don&#39;t loose sight of our common goals.</p>

<h3><font size=""4"">We believe the Fediverse should be a place for respectful discourse and we stand against harassment, trolling and spam.</font></h3>

<p>Everybody&#39;s boundaries are to be respected.</p>

<h3><font size=""4"">We stand up for peace and against violence, oppression and authoritarianism.</font></h3>

<p>We are pacifists, but acknowledge that when attacked, people have the right to defend themselves following international law.
We may be critical of states in general, but we never deny any country their statehood.
We condemn violence against innocent people and always show solidarity with victims of violence. We don&#39;t promote violence in protest, but peaceful sabotage against oppressors is not violence.</p>

<h3><font size=""4"">We stand behind the science and against fake-news & propaganda.</font></h3>

<p>We are not all scientists ourselves and experts in every field we post about, but we try not to spread any false information. If possible we provide reliable sources. We don&#39;t spread unverified rumors.</p>

<h3><font size=""6.5"">RULES</font></h3>

<ul>
<li>follow Austrian and EU law</li>
<li>don&#39;t post pornography</li>
</ul>

<h3><font size=""6.5"">GUIDELINES</font></h3>

<p>Try to always:</p>

<ul>
<li>provide media descriptions</li>
<li>use CamelCase in hashtags</li>
<li>not overdo it with emojis</li>
<li>use content warnings when appropriate</li>
<li>hide sensitive media</li>
<li>avoid links to privacy violating sites if possible</li>
</ul>

<h3><font size=""6.5"">DISCLAIMER</font></h3>

<p>Principles, rules and guidelines may change at any time and sanctions may be applied according to rules that have not been written yet at that time, but of course never without justification. Appeal is always possible.</p>

<h3><font size=""6.5"">MODERATION POLICIES</font></h3>

<p>These are just examples for further clarification. Our principles, rules and guidelines above are what you have to stick to.</p>

<p>What will get you banned immediately:</p>

<ul>
<li>open discrimination</li>
<li>right wing ideologies</li>
<li>harassment, trolling, spam and porn</li>
<li>calls for violence</li>
<li>sympathy for oppression</li>
<li>pro-authoritarianism</li>
<li>spreading of anti-science stances, fake news or propaganda</li>
<li>breaking the law drastically or repeatedly</li>
</ul>

<p>When will we ask you to leave our instance:</p>

<ul>
<li>when you don&#39;t align with our principles</li>
<li>when you follow our rules, but post almost nothing related to climate justice</li>
<li>when you appear more critical of other leftists than the people on the right</li>
<li>when we recorded multiple strikes against you</li>
<li>when you show a pattern of failing to condemn violence or show unreflected solidarity with a violent, oppressive or authoritarian group of people</li>
<li>when you do things that break Austrian law, but are okay somewhere else</li>
<li>when even after multiple hints you completely disregard our guidelines</li>
</ul>

<p>What will get your post deleted and a strike recorded against you:</p>

<ul>
<li>likely unintentional discriminatory behavior or wording</li>
<li>likely unintentional behavior that doesn&#39;t respect someone else&#39;s bondaries</li>
<li>likely unintentionally posting something that could lead to violence</li>
<li>likely unintentional spreading of false or unverified information</li>
<li>when you post something that we fear might get us in trouble with the law</li>
</ul>

<p>When will we ask you to edit your post and/or consider something for the future:</p>

<ul>
<li>clearly unintentional inconsiderate or unreflective behavior or wording</li>
</ul>

<h2>KOLEKTIVA.SOCIAL CODE OF CONDUCT</h2>
Coming up with this policy has been a bit of a balancing act. On the one hand, we do not want to make too many hard-and-fast rules. We are anarchists, and therefore, we do not care to think too long about how to govern every aspect of how other people should behave. On the other hand, don't want our collective resources to be used to spread ideas that go against our values. To this end, we have come up with the following guidelines. We plan on adapting and changing these guidelines over time, and are open to feedback, critique, and suggestions from other Mastodon users, moderators and administrators.<br/>

As a user of this platform, please be mindful that your username ends with @kolektiva.social and your actions, in part, represent the instance. Your engagement builds an expression, and the values you share reverberate from within and outside this digital neighbourhood.

<h2>WHAT YOU SHOULDN'T POST AT ALL:</h2>
Posts containing the following content will be removed, and users will have their accounts immediately suspended and/or deleted.<br/>

<ul><li>Racist, misogynistic, transphobic, homophobic, ableist slurs, or other derogatory pejoratives for oppressed identity groups (unless you belong to that group and are reclaiming the term)</li>
<li>Blatantly racist, casteist, ableist, sexist, transphobic, or otherwise chauvinistic and bigoted discourse</li>
<li>Symbols and slogans associated with fascist regimes and/or fascist, third-positionist, western chauvinist or white nationalist movements</li>
<li>Arguments that seek to deny or cast doubt on historic or ongoing acts of genocide</li>
<li>Pornographic and/or sexualized images depicting people who did not consent to their image being shared</li>
<li>Pedophilia/MAP content, in all its manifestations</li>
<li>Purposeful misinformation</li>
<li>Spam</li></ul>

<h2>WHAT YOU SHOULDN'T <i>REALLY</i> POST:</h2>

<p>Kolektiva.social is an anarchist/anti-colonial instance. Posts containing the following content may be reported and/or removed, and the user may be issued a warning. Repeated warnings may lead to accounts being suspended, and/or their users being encouraged to migrate their account to another instance.</p>

<ul><li>Propaganda from politicians or political parties that seek to win elections</li>
<li>Propaganda from the USSR, CCP, or DPRK</li>
<li>Glorification of nation states and/or militarism</li>
<li>Messages promoting capitalism or meritocracy</li>
<li>Messages promoting or encouraging pseudoscience, conspiracism, or breaks with reality</li>
<li>Targeted harassment (i.e. evading blocks, repeated hostile replies, or posts intended to instigate brigading/dogpiling against a user or another instance), even for righteous reasons</li>
<li> Posts that could bring avoidable legal repression down upon Kolektiva's admins and/or server infrastructure (i.e. doxxing individuals paired with explicit calls for violence or threats against them)</li>
<li>Religious proselytizing/recruitment</li>

<h2>POSTS THAT SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED WITH A CONTENT WARNING:</h2>
We have neither the capacity nor the slightest interest in monitoring all content posted on Kolektiva.social, nor do we enjoy making judgments about what is, or is not, acceptable speech. For this reason, we encourage people to use Mastodon's built-in Content Warning (CW) tool to label posts that other users may find upsetting. Unlabeled posts that are reported to us as containing the following content will have a Content Warning added to them, and the user will be notified.

<br><br>

Accounts that regularly post the following types of posts without Content Warnings may have their accounts silenced, or suspended, based on the severity of the behavior, and may be asked by the moderators to migrate to another instance.<br>

<ul><li>Any visual depiction of nudity</li>
<li>Any visual depiction of blood, severe injuries, torture, murder, or medical procedures</li>
<li>Any unambiguous visual depictions of drug use or drug paraphernalia</li>
<li>Any message detailing sexual acts</li>
<li>Any message mentioning suicide, self-harm, abuse, rape, or sexual assault that does not relate to a current issue</li>
<li>Spoilers (within reason)</li></ul>

<p>Apart from what is itemized above, we do not have specific guidelines for Content Warnings. All users are encouraged to be considerate of others’ needs and preferences, particularly with respect to things that are widely considered repulsive or distressing (for example, the worst events in human history and the worst things that people can do to each other).<br><br></p>

<p>We explicitly do not, and never will, require users to tag political content and news-related posts.</p>

<p><h3>Special Cases Worth Extra Explanation:</h3><br>
<strong>Nudity, sex, drugs, and drug paraphernalia.</strong> We want Kolektiva.social to be as accessible as possible to minors, incarcerated people, and others whose internet access is monitored. These subjects, when visible on the public timeline, may lead to authorities speedily and irreversibly blacklisting our website in a way that political content may not. For this reason, and some others, we ask that all images depicting these subjects be accompanied with a Content Warning.<br><br></p>

<p><strong>The COVID-19 pandemic.</strong> COVID-19 is a real disease, and vaccines and masks are useful measures for impeding its spread. We will treat messages to the contrary as either &quot;Purposeful misinformation&quot; or &quot;Messages promoting or encouraging pseudoscience, conspiracism, or breaks with reality&quot; as itemized earlier. It&#39;s not that we think various  &quot;experts&quot;, on health subjects or others, are entirely beyond questioning. It&#39;s simply that we also disdain our platform being used to spread health myths that are, by and large, generated and boosted in the same parts of the internet as far right conspiracy theories about the present order.<br><br></p>

<p><strong>The Russo-Ukrainian War.</strong> We do not want our instance flooded with pro-war propaganda. We will not censor discussion of the Ukrainian far right or other problems in Ukrainian society, but we may consider gross exaggerations of these problems as propaganda aimed at providing rhetorical cover for the Russian state&#39;s imperialist aggression. We may view links to Russian state-affiliated media as &quot;purposeful misinformation&quot; or &quot;messages promoting or encouraging pseudoscience, conspiracism, or breaks with reality&quot; as itemized earlier. We may also view posts supporting NATO and/or Ukrainian nationalism as &quot;messages glorifying the nation state and/or militarism&quot;.<br><br></p>

<p><strong>Analogizing Israel and Nazi Germany.</strong> We support the self-determination of the Palestinian people as well as the destruction of the ethnonationalist Israeli state, alongside all states, and we are glad to host content celebrating Palestinians&#39; anti-colonial struggle and denouncing Israeli atrocities. Rhetoric comparing Israelis and/or Zionists to the historic German Nazis, however, is as unnecessary and unhelpful as it is insulting to Jews, including anti-Zionist Jewish comrades. We consider it a form of &quot;chauvinistic and bigoted discourse&quot; as itemized earlier.<br><br></p>

<p><strong>Astrology.</strong> We don’t believe in it but it’s fine.<br><br></p>

<h1>USING KOLEKTIVA.SOCIAL</h1>

<h2>BLOCKING AND MUTING</h2>

<p>We encourage users to make use of the block and mute options to help control what content appears on their timelines. While moderators will do our best to block bad offenders and defederate from toxic instances, we recognize that people have different limits and expectations of the fediverse, and these options allow for a more personalized experience. Evading blocks and mutes is not part of respectful engagement, and may lead to suspension and deleting of accounts, and a permanent ban from Kolektiva.social.</p>

<p>Instructions on how to use personalized Block and Mute controls can be found <a href=""https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moderating/"">here</a>.</p>

<h2>REPORTING</h2>

<p>Unlike centralized and corporate social media platforms, the process of moderation on Kolektiva.social is intended to be accountable. The users who make up the moderation team are listed publicly for this reason. We want to receive reports regarding all forms of unacceptable behavior (that we can reasonably respond to), and we will do our best to follow up within a reasonable time frame.</p>

<p>Instructions on how to report a post can be found <a href=""https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moderating/"">here</a>.</p>

<h2>NOTES ON REPORTING</h2>

<ul><li>Reports made by users on other fediverse instances about Kolektiva.social users are anonymous. For example, if @example@mastodon.online reports a Kolektiva.social user, we will see that a user from <a href=""https://mastodon.online/about/more/"">Mastodon.online</a> has sent a report, but not their username. We cannot respond to users about their reports if we do not know who they are. We always know which Kolektiva.social users have issued which reports, however.</li>
<li>Reports without explanations are significantly harder to follow up on. Links, explanations, and other information are encouraged and appreciated. Furthermore, we cannot reasonably take actions against users when there is no proof of bad behavior or ill intent. Please include examples and/or reasons in your reports.</li>
<li>A report does not guarantee the moderation response that you've requested. If reporting users are not satisfied with our decisions, we suggest using the Mute or Block functions.</li></ul>

<h2>ACCESSIBILITY</h2>

<p>We encourage the usage of captions and descriptive text when posting images, in order to make your posts more accessible to users who use screen readers. For the same reason, we also discourage the usage of excessive emojis or unicode text symbols in posts or usernames.<br><br></p>

<p>Our instance is open to users of any language. The most commonly spoken language among Kolektiva.social mods and admins is English, but we can also communicate in French, Haitian Creole, Portuguese and Spanish. Unfortunately, members of our moderation team won’t be able to effectively communicate in other languages apart from those listed above.<br><br></p>

<p>If contacted by users speaking other languages, we may seek out help from other Kolektiva.social users or the admins and mods of other instances. Barring that, we may make use of online translation software.</p>

<h2>SAFETY AND DANGER ON THE FEDIVERSE</h2>

<p>The Kolektiva.social moderation team is made up of relative newcomers to the fediverse, but we understand that all of the problems associated with other online spaces are also present here. Some of these problems relate to surveillance by institutions that aim for social control, and some relate to the forms of oppressive and anti-social behavior that permeate broader society. Most of the members of our collective are anarchists who have been involved in social movements for years. That is to say, we understand a few things about how repression works. We also know how and why anarchists get into fights with one another, because we have been in a few fights ourselves. At the same time, there’s lots that we don’t know.<br><br></p>

<p>As a group, we can draw on a pretty wide array of experiences, but some problems around technical security are simply very complicated, and the same is true of some of the controversies that unfold in local scenes, or over the Internet in general. We will do our best to address issues as they come up. But because we are real people who live in this constantly changing world, we are likely to make mistakes. We also simply won&#39;t be able to satisfy all the (sometimes competing) requests and reports that we receive from users.<br><br></p>

<p>We believe that it is imperative that anarchists and social movements abandon surveillance capitalist platforms. In fact, we think everyone on Earth should abandon these services. Platforms like Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter spy on us, hand our personal data over to hostile forces, and help to poison political discourse through monetized algorithms and the spread of reactionary ideologies. We want Kolektiva.social to be able to serve as a landing pad for people who are new to Mastodon, the fediverse, etc. For this reason, we are intentionally set up as a large, welcoming instance with open registrations. We have no interest in hosting fascists or other annoying and miserable people (and will ban them once we have a good reason to do so), but obviously some of the people on this platform may be ruder, rougher, and less sensitive than those found on smaller, more community-focused Mastodon/Hometown instances. When we talk about a mass exodus from corporate social media, we recognize that this will involve all sorts of people, and not just those who we already agree with. To paraphrase Maurice Moe Mitchell: we have a low bar to entry and a high standard for conduct.<br><br></p>

<p>We want to allow people to learn how they want to conduct themselves before removing them. That said, even though we intend to be open and welcoming, we will not allow arguments around &quot;free speech&quot; to serve as cover for harmful, entitled, and/or obnoxious behavior. We are aware of the broad conversations taking place around anti-Blackness and other forms of racism on the fediverse, and we take this seriously.<br><br></p>

<p>While we see it as important to provide a space where users can be themselves and reach out to others as they wish, repeatedly posting unsolicited opinions on other people&#39;s posts, playing “devil&#39;s advocate” with strangers, and other similar forms of obnoxious behavior have their limit, before they become a pattern. If you are having problems with a specific user, please feel free to reach out to one of our moderators for help with explaining microaggressions and subtly oppressive behaviors.</p>

<h2>DEFEDERATING FROM OTHER INSTANCES</h2>

<p>We will do our best to remain defederated from the most toxic parts of the fediverse, and will attempt to keep up-to-date on collective initiatives such as <a href=""https://kolektiva.social/tags/fediblock"">#fediblock</a>. But to maintain Kolektiva.social&apos;s usefulness as a communications tool and social media platform, we don’t intend to defederate from large instances based on the actions of a small minority of their membership. We also don’t want to turn defederation into our activism.<br><br></p>

<p>Given Kolektiva.social’s relatively large size on the fediverse (and especially in the “anarchist neighborhood”), we recognize that any decisions that we take to defederate from a given instance can severely limit that instance’s users’ ability to learn about, and engage with, various worthwhile sorts of information that Kolektiva.social users are putting onto the fediverse. Because of this, we will rely more heavily on suspending and silencing individual accounts, unless the instance itself is irredeemable. We will do our best to maintain open lines of communications with other admins, and to pass on reports about their users where we deem it necessary/appropriate.<br><br></p>

<h2>A NOTE ON DECENTRALIZATION</h2>

<p>We are aware of the criticism of large centralized Mastodon instances, and the arguments for a more decentralized network of smaller Mastodon servers. We are sympathetic to these criticisms for a number of reasons, not least of which being that they often come from our fellow anarchists. We encourage our users to find another instance that they find fits their expectations and views, or barring that, to create their own.<br><br></p>

<p>That said, we also see a need for large instances with open registration that can serve as landing pads for those escaping from corporate social media platforms. This is a role that we see Kolektiva.social filling as we move forward with our short-term goals. We will continue to assess our role in the fediverse moving forward, and are open to dialogue with other groups about what this can and should look like. As noted earlier, we plan on producing a series of resources aimed at helping people set up and manage their own Mastodon instances.</p>

<h2>A BRIEF HISTORY OF KOLEKTIVA</h2>

<p>Kolektiva was launched in June of 2020 by anarchist media collectives Antimídia and subMedia with the aim of developing autonomous, digital communication infrastructure for the movements we support and participate in. It soon expanded into an informal organization with members based in a handful of places all around the world. Kolektiva&apos;s first project was a PeerTube instance, <a href=""https://kolektiva.media/"">Kolektiva.media</a>.<br><br></p>

<p>Its purpose was to offer a free, non-corporate platform for anarchists and anti-colonial content producers looking to bypass Google, Facebook, and other surveillance capitalist firms, as well as censorship mandated and enforced by governments. When Facebook began purging a number of pages associated with anarchist and antifascist projects in July 2020, Kolektiva set up a Mastodon instance, <a href=""https://kolektiva.social/"">Kolektiva.social</a>. It has grown rapidly since then, thanks in large part to its open registrations and the increasingly widespread and apparent need for alternatives to the dominant social media platforms. It is important to note that Kolektiva.social started as an ad hoc response to a specific problem, mainly related to the ability of social movements to broadcast information publicly, in the context of the summer&#39;s rebellion, and that none of the Kolektiva team were, at that time, especially familiar with the fediverse, from a social point of view, when we started this instance.<br><br></p>

<p>There were controversies, arguments, and accusations. So, as we entered 2021, Kolektiva.social began an (ongoing) effort to expand our number of moderators and to clarify our expectations of users, and users’ expectations of us. Kolektiva.social is just one component of a larger project that is aimed at getting as many people off of corporate social media as possible, and especially people who are involved in anti-colonial, anti-capitalist, and anti-fascist movements. It is also a volunteer project, and time is limited. As a result, we expect it to take us a while to really get a handle of what we&#39;re trying to accomplish here, how we should try to accomplish it, and what exactly is within our capacities. Nevertheless, we don&#39;t intend to go anywhere, and we are committed to learning from our mistakes and always improving on past failures.</p>

<h2>THE GOALS OF KOLEKTIVA</h2>

<p>Kolektiva exists to provide digital infrastructure for anarchist and anti-colonial movements. We seek to enable as many people as possible to share news and information without relying on centralized and intensively surveilled platforms. We are motivated in this work by the principle of internationalism, and a desire to increase communication and collaboration across state-imposed borders and linguistic divides.<br><br>
In the coming years, we hope to scale up the project in a number of ways by doing all of the following:<br><br>
<ol>
<li>encouraging the exodus of anarchists and other anti-capitalists/anti-colonialists from corporate platforms towards independent, open-source alternatives such as those offered by Kolektiva</li>
<li>producing instructional videos for new users, and resources for those seeking to set up their own fediverse sites/instances</li>
<li>building up our physical server infrastructure and technical capacity</li>
<li>expanding and diversifying our moderation team</li>
<li>experimenting with other <a href=""https://activitypub.rocks/"">ActivityPub</a> platforms, such as <a href=""https://mobilizon.org/en/"">Mobilizon</a> and <a href=""https://pixelfed.org/"">Pixelfed</a></li>
<li>introducing a new framework to better organize content and facilitate translation</li></ol></p>

Per il progresso e l&#39;innovazione scientifica sono importanti le &quot;eresie&quot;, i cambi di paradigma, le ipotesi contrarie al consenso scientifico corrente, ma vanno confrontati con la comunità scientifica nel contesto della ricerca e non gettati nel calderone della comunicazione pubblica dove si mischiano a informazioni false e fuorvianti che mettono a rischio la salute altrui. Per questo motivo, chi vuole condividere o pubblicare pseudoscienza, antiscienza o &quot;scienza non ufficiale&quot; in contrasto con la migliore conoscenza scientifica disponibile (espressa nel consenso della comunità scientifica, dalle istituzioni accademice e dalle istituzioni sanitarie nazionali e internazionali) può farlo in tanti contesti ma non su sociale.network, che non è un ambiente preposto a distinguere tra disinformazione e innovazione, e non vuole esporre i propri utenti ai rischi della disinformazione sanitaria. Se sono scoperte rivoluzionarie, prima di metterle in giro sui social spiegatele agli esperti fino a quando queste scoperte non saranno confermate da persone qualificate e competenti. Se è disinformazione scientifica, diffondetela dove vi pare ma non qui, perché questo è uno spazio dove la comunità degli utenti pratica l&#39;autodifesa dalla disinformazione per condividere la migliore conoscenza disponibile.</span></li></p>

<p><li class=""c2 c6""><span class=""c0"">Il &quot;doxxing&quot;, ovvero la pratica di rivelare informazioni personali e private di persone che scelgono di esercitare il diritto umano universale all&#39;anonimato per esprimersi liberamente.</span></p>

<p><li class=""c2 c6""><span class=""c0"">L&#39;abuso delle hashtag. Non ci sono algoritmi che vi mandano in tendenza nelle timeline a seconda degli hashtag che usate. Nei toot cerchiamo di usare solo hashtag pertinenti, perché aggiungendo hashtag che non c&#39;entrano nulla i contenuti non diventano piu&#39; visibili e si &quot;inquina&quot; il feed dell&#39;hashtag con toot che non c&#39;entrano nulla con l&#39;hashtag in questione, complicando la vita alle altre persone.</span></p>

<h2>长毛象如何使用</h2>

<p>新来的朋友们，如果想要详细地探索长毛象的功能，请仔细阅读
<a href=""https://docs.joinmastodon.org/zh-cn/user/signup/"">官方文档</a><br/>
墙内的朋友们可以
<a href=""https://docs.mastodon.bgme.bid/zh-cn/user/signup/"">点击这里</a><br/></p>

<p>一些新人常见的问题：<br/>
1. 用什么app好？<br/>
长毛象的网页功能足够强大，对于新手，最推荐的是先熟悉网页版功能之后再探索app。手机用户可以将网页保存到桌面替代app使用。<br/>
如果一定需要app，可以参考：<br/>
<a href=""https://joinmastodon.org/apps"">https://joinmastodon.org/apps</a><br/></p>

<ol>
<li><p>回复在哪里？转发在哪里？<br/>
嘟文下面的四个按钮依次为：【回复（箭头）、转发（回环）、喜欢（星星）、更多（…）】。点开“更多”，还可以使用书签等功能。<br/>
长毛象不设置“带评转发”功能以避免“挂人”的滥用。您的评论只会显示在同时关注你和你评论对象的用户首页，不必担心刷屏。<br/>
在短时间内首页对同一条嘟文的转发将仅出现一次，避免刷屏。<br/></p></li>
<li><p>“嘟文公开程度”是什么意思？<br/>
嘟文公开程度分为四个等级：<br/></p></li>
<li><p>公开（地球）：在公共时间轴显示。<br/></p></li>
<li><p>不公开（开着的锁）：在你的主页和关注者首页显示，不在公共时间轴显示，不会在相应tag搜索中出现。<br/></p></li>
<li><p>仅关注（关着的锁）：仅关注你的人可见。<br/></p></li>
<li><p>仅提及（信封）：仅艾特对象可见，类似于私信功能。<br/></p></li>
<li><p>怎么搜索？<br/>
为避免骚扰，长毛象有意弱化搜索功能。如果您希望自己的嘟文被搜索到，【请将嘟文公开程度设置为“公开”，并打上相应tag。】<br/>
实例可搜索内容包括：具体账号、具体嘟文地址、tag。<br/>
如果实例开启了全文搜索，则还能搜到：你发的嘟文、你点了喜欢或转发的嘟文、提及你的嘟文。请使用英文双引号&quot; &quot;和+/-号进行嘟文筛选和精确搜索。<br/></p></li>
<li><p>本站时间轴、跨站时间轴是什么意思？<br/>
本站时间轴：本站用户发表的公开原创嘟文。<br/>
跨站时间轴：本站关注的外站用户发表的公开原创嘟文及本站用户回复、转发的外站公开嘟文。<br/></p></li>
</ol>

<p>另外，一些使用技巧：<br/>
1. 首选项-其他-公共时间轴语言过滤：可选择你希望出现的语言。<br/>
2. 首选项-外观-自动播放 GIF 动画：打开之后你会发现很多表情动了起来。<br/>
3. 首选项-其他-禁止搜索引擎建立索引：可以禁止google等搜索到你的嘟文。<br/>
4. 过滤器：关键词屏蔽。<br/>
5. 3.2.0以上版本，点开表情栏之后按ctrl+鼠标，可以使表情栏不收回，在连续选择很多表情时有用。<br/>
6. 上传音频和视频后，点击“编辑”，可以上传音频和视频的封面图片。此外图片和视频也可以在此加上文字描述以服务视障人群。<br/>
7. 首选项-外观-启用高级web界面：首页将以四栏形式显示，提高效率。<br/>
<br/>
其他具体的使用方法，请仔细阅读官方文档进行探索。<br/>

<h3>Über Uns</h3>

<p>Wir sind eine freundliche Mastodon Instanz aus Nordrhein-Westfalen. Ob NRW&#39;ler oder NRW-Sympathifanten, jeder ist hier willkommen.</p>

<h3>Verhaltensregeln</h3>

<p>Auf nrw.social ist unsere Hauptrichtlinie:<br>
    → &quot;Seid nett zueinander!&quot;</p>
<p>Leider ist das nicht immer so einfach wie es klingt, daher haben wir hier ein paar Punkte zusammengefasst, um dir
    einen Einblick in unsere Moderationsrichtlinien zu geben. Die endgültige Auslegung obliegt dem Team von
    NRW.social. Wir behalten uns das Recht vor, Toots zu löschen oder einen Account zu blockieren,
    wenn Probleme bestehen.</p>

<strong>Respektiere, dass andere Menschen auch andere Gefühle, Meinungen und Erfahrungen haben als du.</strong><br><br>
Wir tolerieren insbesondere nicht:
<ul>
    <li>Belästigungen, Stalking, Doxing oder Dogpiling</li>
    <li>Hassrede, Rassismus, Sexismus, Beschimpfungen oder deren Befürwortung</li>
    <li>Diskriminierung von Geschlechtern und sexuellen Minderheiten</li>
    <li>Gewalttätige nationalistische Propaganda, Nazi-Symbolismus oder Förderung der Ideologie des Nationalsozialismus</li>
    <li>Verbreiten von Falschinformationen</li>
    <li>Aufrufe zu Gewalttaten</li>
    <li>In Deutschland illegale Inhalte</li>
    <li>Sexueller Inhalt oder Gewaltdarstellungen</li>
    <li>Nicht markierter Sexueller Inhalt von fremden Instanzen</li>
    <li>Nicht markierte, automatisierte oder übermäßige Werbung und reine Werbe-Accounts</li>
    <li>Bots, die ohne ihre expliziten Anfragen mit Nutzern interagieren</li>
</ul>

<p>Wenn du nicht mit jemandem interagieren möchtest oder einen seiner Beiträge nicht sehen möchtest, stehen dir Tools
    wie die Mute- und Blockfunktionen zur Verfügung. Bitte melde Verhalten, von dem du glaubst, dass es die Regeln verletzt. Das schließt Verhalten von anderen Instanzen mit ein.<br/>
Achte auch darauf was du postest. Toots auf Mastodon sind erst einmal öffentlich und das Internet vergisst nie! Wenn du nicht möchtest, dass jeder deine Beiträge lesen kann, verwende die Privatsphäre-Einstellungen.
</p>

<p><hr>
<h3>Föderation</h3>
<p><a href=""https://nrw.social"">NRW.social</a> glaubt nicht an Zensur. Fediverse ist ein Netzwerkdienst
    und die Aussetzung der Fediverse mit einem anderen Server wird nur als letztes Mittel durchgeführt.
    Sollten aber einzelne Instanzen dauerhaft entgegen unserer Regeln handeln, können diese durch uns stummgeschaltet oder gesperrt werden.
    Haben wir deiner Meinung nach eine falsche Entscheidung getroffen? Dann kontaktiere uns!</p></p>

<h3>E-Mail-Anbieter</h3>

<p>Eigentlich möchten wir euch bei der Wahl eures Mail-Anbieters nicht einschränken. Leider kommt es bei folgenden Mail-Anbietern zu Problemen, weshalb eine Registrierung (eventuell) nicht möglich ist:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>gmail.com</strong><br>Da sich ein Großteil der Spam-Accounts mit gmail.com registriert, haben wir die Registrierung über gmail.com gesperrt. Habt ihr eure Mail-Adresse bei Google, könnt ihr bei der Registrierung einfach <strong>gmail.com</strong> durch <strong>googlemail.com</strong> ersetzen.</li>
<li><strong>outlook, live, hotmail</strong><br>Leider sperrt Microsoft gerne kleinere Mail-Server wie unseren. Die Registrierungsmails können dann nicht zugestellt werden. Wir empfehlen euch generell einen anderen Mail-Anbieter zu verwenden, da nie garantiert werden kann, dass Mails die euch erreichen sollen, auch ankommen.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Backups und Verfügbarkeit</h3>

<p>Es werden tägliche Backups der Instanz angelegt.<br>

Wir behalten uns vor, den Dienst jederzeit aus rechtlichen, technischen oder finanziellen Gründen einzuschränken oder zu beenden.

<h2>Moderation</h2>

<p>Diese Instanz wird gemeinschaftlich von mehreren Menschen moderiert, die diese Arbeit rein ehrenamtlich leisten: <a href=""https://graz.social/@OSchaumbirne"">@oschaumbirne</a>, <a href=""https://graz.social/@linos"">@linos</a>, <a href=""https://graz.social/@publicvoit"">@publicvoit</a> und <a href=""https://graz.social/@totoroot"">@totoroot</a></p>

<h2>Empfehlungen und Richtlinien</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Allgemein gelten die weiter unten angeführten Serverregeln.</p></li>
<li><p>Bevor ihr Bilder, Videos oder Ton postet macht Euch bitte Gedanken, <a href=""https://karl-voit.at/2022/01/08/text-vs-video-audio-images/"">ob es einen Mehrwert bietet.</a> Diese brauchen nämlich um das hundert- bis zehntausendfache mehr an Speicherplatz. Das verursacht Kosten, die wir als Gemeinschaft tragen müssen. Wenn ihr doch ein Bild hochladet empfehlen wir einen alt-Text hinzuzufügen.</p></li>
<li><p>Automatisierte Beiträge und hochfrequente Beiträge sollten nicht gelistet werden (d. h. sie sollten für alle sichtbar sein, aber nicht in der lokalen Zeitleiste erscheinen), damit die lokale Zeitleiste unserer Instanz ein Ort des Gemeinschaftsdialogs und der menschlichen Interaktion bleibt. Die offiziellen iOS und Android Apps besitzen diese Möglichkeit aktuell noch nicht, wegen wir</p>

<ul>
<li>Einsteigern empfehlen, Mastodon zuerst im Browser kennen zu lernen</li>
<li>Für iOS Metalab und für Android Tusky zu verwenden</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Interpretiert konträre Meinungen anderer so wohlwollend wie möglich. Fragt im Zweifel besser einmal „zu viel“ nach, wie etwas gemeint war. Haltet euch vor Augen, dass hinter jedem Blogeintrag, Post, jedem Kommentar usw. ein Mensch steht, der ganz unterschiedlich Lebenserfahrungen gemacht hat</p></li>
<li><p>Meinungsvielfalt ist ein zentrales Element eines progressiven Diskurses, jedoch lässt sich oft kaum vermeiden, dass bei unterschiedlichen Meinungen die Wogen hoch gehen. Wir sind uns bewusst, dass es beinahe zu jeder Angelegenheit zwei völlig widerstreitende Ansichten geben mag. Genau deshalb sollten wir unbedingt Rücksicht aufeinander nehmen.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Moderierte Sprachen</h2>

<p>Unsere Moderatoren versuchen, unabhängig von politischer Ausrichtung, alle Posts gleichwertig und objektiv entlang unserer Serverregeln zu moderieren. Natürlich ist das nur für Sprachen möglich, die wir auch verstehen - daher sind als Sprachen auf unseren Instanzen nur Deutsch und Englisch möglich. Wir behalten uns das Einschränken oder Löschen von Nachrichten in anderen Sprachen im Zweifel vor. </p>

<h2>Altersgrenze / Minderjährige</h2>

234,604db76e88f1bd03b0d0ff07,mastodon.world,False,181475,"<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>(For the <strong>rules</strong> scroll down below!!)</p>

<p>This Code contains the rules and principles for participating in the Mastodon.world community. It is intended to protect all members of our community from harassment and to ensure that our community is as welcoming and inclusive as possible. This is a working document, so the Mastodon.world team may amend it from time to time.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<ul>
<li>Provide a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for everyone regardless of gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, political affiliation, or other similar characteristic.</li>
<li>Create a supportive community, where people freely share their passions and are excited and positive about each other’s successes.</li>
<li>Protect our community from harassment, malicious or illegal content and from individual members whose goals are to disrupt our community and promote their own self-interest at the expense of the community.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Principles that Guide us</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>We are not a free speech zone.</strong> This CoC lays out expected standards of conduct and behavior. You cannot say or post anything that violates these rules or principles and remain a member of our community. You must follow this CoC. If you are looking for something else, please do. It is not here.</li>
<li><strong>The Moderators are not morality or thought police.</strong> Moderators are guided by this Code of Conduct. Post what you want, if what you post follows these rules, principles and the goals outlined above. Not every member of the community will appreciate controversial or explicit posts so use Content Warnings very liberally. We use Content Warnings so community members themselves can decide whether they want to see or engage with a post that may be controversial or explicit.</li>
<li><strong>Bullies, trolls and disruptors</strong> are not welcome in Mastodon.world. We will moderate accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>This is a voluntary community. You chose to be here.</strong> When you choose to join, you have implied that you agree with this Code of Conduct and will follow it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rules for posting</h2>

<p>The rules you need to follow if you want to be a member of our community are stated below.</p>

<h2>General guidance on posting and participating in Mastodon.world</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Do not post about inflammatory, controversial subjects without a Content Warning.</strong> Ideally, you would not post about inflammatory subjects at all. However, it may be acceptable to do so in some cases, but it is never acceptable to post inflammatory content without hiding the content behind an appropriate Content Warning.</li>
<li><strong>Do not post any type of nudity without a Content Warning.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Regarding Spam: We are not your free advertising platform.</strong> If you are here only to sell your products or services, you will be removed. Occasional posts of commercial links are OK, but when the vast majority of a user&#39;s posts are commercial in nature, we regard the account as a Spam account. Moderators will evaluate reports of Spam on a case by case basis.</li>
<li><strong>Do not engage in name calling</strong>, <a href=""https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ad%20hominem"">ad hominem</a> attacks, or any other uncivil behaviour. Criticize ideas, never people.</li>
<li><strong>Misgendering</strong>, the act of referring to someone using a gender or pronouns that do not correctly reflect their gender identity, is prohibited. Deliberate or targeted misgendering, where there is an intentional refusal to respect an individual&#39;s self-identified gender and pronouns, is considered a form of harassment and discrimination. </li>
<li><strong>Deadnaming</strong>, which involves referring to a transgender or gender-diverse person by a name they used before their gender transition, is prohibited.</li>
<li><strong>The promotion or endorsement of so-called &quot;conversion therapy&quot;</strong> or any related programs or practices is prohibited. Conversion therapy, which aims to change an individual’s sexual orientation or gender identity, is a discredited practice that is harmful and disrespectful to the LGBTQ+ community.</li>
<li><strong>Do not report every post that upsets you.</strong> Please report posts that violate our rules but for others that you may find distasteful, or just don’t like, use the tools available to you. You can block the user or mute the conversation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Moderation Principles</h2>

<p>Reported content will be assessed on a balance of probabilities by the moderators. In other words, whether it is more likely than not that the content violates one or more of these rules. Moderators will suspend an account from mastodon.world when the user demonstrates that they have breached any rule several times, or if their content (including profile description) suggests that they are likely to continue to break the rules. The number of breaches leading to suspension is deliberately not defined. In egregious cases, one breach can result in suspension of the user account.
<br><br>
The moderation team takes a pragmatic approach to every report they receive - if they feel that a problematic post isn’t explicitly a breach of any of these rules but is inappropriate for Mastodon.world, the post will likely be removed. Users who repeatedly post problematic content or otherwise are seen by the moderators as a negative, disruptive presence in our community can be removed at the discretion of the moderation team, even if those posts or the user did not explicitly violate our rules.</p>

Nichtbeachtung kann verschiedene Maßnahmen wie einfache Ermahnungen, Löschung von Beiträgen, zeitweise/dauerhafte Sperrungen bis hin zur Löschung eines Kontos zur Folge haben.<br>
Einige dieser Maßnahmen können auch bei Nutzer:innen anderer Instanzen erfolgen. Auch die Sperrung aller Inhalte anderer Instanzen ist möglich.</p>

<h3>Accounts</h3>
<p>Diese Instanz ist für den persönlichen Austausch natürlicher Nutzer:innen und der Präsentation von Vereinigungen oder Organisationen mit Sitz in Hessen gedacht. Voll-automatisierte Accounts sind nicht gestattet. Das schließt insbesondere Accounts ein, auf denen mit Automationswerkzeugen geposted, aber nie anders interagiert wird (Antworten, Boosten, etc.). Ausnahmen von dieser Regelung siehe „Bots“.<br>
Aktive Nutzer:innen dürfen ergänzend Werkzeuge für automatisches Posten verwenden. (z.B. Crossposter).</p>

<h3>Mindestalter</h3>
Unser Angebot erfordert eine Zustimmung zu den Datenschutzrichtlinien. Gemäß DSGVO ist dies nur Personen möglich die das 16. Lebensjahr vollendet haben. Wenn du unter 16 Jahren bist, darfst du diese Plattform daher leider nicht benutzen.

<h3>Allgemeine Verhaltensregeln</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sei immer freundlich und höflich. Behandle andere mit Respekt.</li>
<li>Belästige und beleidige niemanden und unterlasse persönliche Angriffe.Weder allein noch als Gruppe. Das Veröffentlichen oder die Androhung von Veröffentlichung von personen-identifizierenden Informationen (""doxing"") wird als Belästigung ausgelegt.</li>
<li>Kontaktiere keine Nutzer:innen die angegeben haben, dass sie nicht kontaktiert werden möchten.</li>
<li>Die Nutzung oder Befürwortung von rassistischer, sexistischer, homophober, transphober, behindertenfeindlicher und anderweitig diskriminierender oder hasserfüllter Sprache bzw. verharmlosende oder gutheißende Inhalte zu Weißer Vorherrschaft, Antisemitismus, Transphobie oder anderen hasserfüllten Ideologien wird nicht geduldet.</li>
<li>Nochmal ganz deutlich: Wir dulden keine nationalistische Propaganda, keine Nazi-Symbolik und keine Förderung der Ideologie des Nationalsozialismus!</li>
<li>Nachgewiesene Falschinformationen/Fakenews sind hier unerwünscht.</li>
<li>Poste keine pornographischen oder sexualisierten Inhalte. Dazu gehören auch Witze und Kommentare.</li>
<li>Halte dich an die in Deutschland geltenden Gesetze (verbietet u.a. auch gewaltverherrlichende Inhalte).</li>
<li>Veröffentliche keinen Spam oder kommerzielle Werbung. Kommerzielle Werbung in diesem Zusammenhang bedeutet, wenn die veröffentlichten Inhalte keinen persönlichen Bezug aufweisen und eindeutig dazu gedacht sind, direkt oder indirekt Geld zu erwirtschaften.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Öffentliche Toots</h3>
<p>Bei öffentliche Toots müssen zusätzlich die folgende Punkte beachtet werden:</p>
<ul>
<li><h5>Nutze Inhaltswarnungen</h5>
Veröffentliche keine Inhalte über kontroverse, aufrührerische oder triggernde Themen ohne eine Inhaltswarnung zu verwenden.</li>
<li><h5>Keine Killerphrasen, schwarze Rhetorik oder Sophismus</h5>
Dies gebietet bereits ein respektvoller Umgang. Dennoch möchten wir nochmals betonen, dass unsachliche Diskussionsbeiträge die der vorsätzlichen Schädigung der Diskussion zur Folge haben unerwünscht sind. Dazu zählen bspw. auch Scheinargument-Attacken (auch ad hominem genannt) oder die Kritik an inklusiver Sprache, wenn diese nicht das Thema der Diskussion ist.</li>
<li><h5>Kritik an Moderationsentscheidungen</h5>
Diskutiere Moderationsentscheidungen nicht zuerst in öffentlichen Toots. Wenn Du nicht einverstanden bist wie ein Moderation diese Bedingungen interpretiert und anwendet, dann kontaktiere uns. Schicke eine Mail an kontakt@hessen.social oder schreibe eine Direktnachricht an @moomendemol@hessen.social</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugs</h3>
<p>Gefundene Fehler in der Software auf hessen.social sind umgehend zu melden.</p>

<h3>Melden & Moderation</h3>
<p>Wenn dir hier ein Toot auffällt, der diesen Kodex verletzt, melde das bitte immer. Es ist gut möglich, dass jemand anderes diesen Inhalt bereits gemeldet hat. Allerdings passiert es schnell, dass alle so denken und es am Ende niemand meldet.</p>

<h3>Bots</h3>
<p>Spezielle Bot-Accounts sind erlaubt, soweit sie die nachfolgenden Bedingungen erfüllen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Es gelten die gleichen Regelungen wie für alle anderen Accounts.</li>
<li>Es muss eine erreichbare Kontaktperson in der Beschreibung des Bots in einem Tabellenfeld 'Kontaktperson' zu finden sein.</li>
<li>Die Profilbeschreibung muss einen kurzen Text über den Sinn und Zweck des Bots enthalten.</li>
<li>Bots dürfen lediglich Nicht gelistet posten, um mehr Raum für relevantere, lokale Inhalte zu bieten.</li>
<li>Ausnahmen von diesen Regelungen sind nach Absprache möglich.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Unzulässige/gesperrte Maildomains</h3>
<p>Aufgrund von zunehmenden Spamaccounts wurde die Nutzung von Wegwerfmailadressen und häufigen Spammerdomains unterbunden (siehe auch nächsten Abschnitt zu gmail.com).<br>
Die gesperrten Domains finden sich hier: <a href=""https://github.com/disposable-email-domains/disposable-email-domains"">https://github.com/disposable-email-domains/disposable-email-domains</a>
<br><br>
Sollte sich in dieser Liste eine Domain befinden die ihr selber nutzt und dort als falsch erachtet, könnt ihr<br>
1. unter dem o.g. Link ein Issue eröffnen um die Domain von der Sperrliste zu nehmen<br>
2. falls 1. nicht klappt oder nicht möglich ist, uns eine Mail schreiben um eine lokale Ausnahme zu erstellen.</p>

<h3>GMail-Nutzer:innen</h3>
<p>Nach zwei Wochen Betrieb zeigt sich bereits, dass von Maildomains mit der Endung ""@gmail.com"" eine enorme Menge Spamaccounts angelegt werden. Daher ist die Domain ab sofort gesperrt.
Wenn du eine Google-Adresse nutzen willst, dann ersetze @gmail.com einfach durch @googlemail.com, das funktioniert auch. Alternativ kannst du natürlich auch eine andere Mailadresse nehmen, am besten von einem Mailprovider der deine Mailinhalte nicht durchforstet und zu Werbezwecken nutzt.</p>

<h3>Automatische Löschung von Accounts</h3>
<p>Wir behalten uns vor, Nutzeraccounts, die keine Aktivität zeigen, zu löschen. Die Aktivität wird unter anderem am letzten Login und der Tootaktivität festgemacht. So fallen bspw. Accounts die 3 Monate ohne Login sind und noch nie etwas getootet haben unter diese Regelung.</p>

<h3>Rechtliches</h3>
Bei der Nutzung des Angebots findet deutsches Recht Anwendung. Gerichtsstand ist Darmstadt. Die Nutzung erfolgt ausschließlich freiwillig. Die Nutzung des Dienstes kann von den Betreiber:innen ohne Angabe von Gründen untersagt werden.
Es gelten die separaten Datenschutzbestimmungen.

<h2>🧬 How does this work?</h2>

<p>Just like a real town there is lots of things happening in your local area. When you are signed up, clicking the <strong>Local</strong> / <strong>Lokal</strong> tab will show you everything that is happening on this website. If you want to explore the wider world, click the <strong>Federated</strong> / <strong>Felles</strong> tab to see <em>everything</em> happening across a lot of websites connected to this one.</p>

<p>When you see someone interesting, <strong>Follow</strong> / <strong>Følg</strong> that person for future updates. They will appear in your <strong>Home</strong> / <strong>Hjem</strong> timeline. You can follow anyone in the whole world - whether they are local or not.</p>

<p>When you see something you didn't want to see, you can <strong>Mute</strong> / <strong>Demp</strong> or <strong>Block</strong> / <strong>Blokkér</strong> that person or the whole website. If you see something on the local timeline which you don't think should be on the internet, you can <strong>Report</strong> / <strong>Rapportér</strong> it to The Mayor.</p>

<p>For a more geeky insight into how the site works, you can <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPSbNdBmWKE"" title=""What is Mastodon? Video Explainer"">watch this YouTube video</a> or <a href=""https://docs.joinmastodon.org/usage/decentralization/"" title=""How does Mastodon work"">read the Documentation</a>.

<hr />

<h2>🏵️ The Mayor</h2>

<p>When you sign up to the website, you will instantly be following <a href=""https://oslo.town/@themayor"" title=""The Mayor of Oslo.town"">@themayor</a> to get the latest updates straight from the oslo.town town hall. It is <em>highly recommended</em> that you follow The Mayor, but it's your life - do what you want - you can always unfollow them.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<h2>🧢 Merchandise</h2>

<p>The lovely people at <a href=""https://oslo.town/@lokk"">@lokk</a> in Oslo have embroidered a baseball cap.</p>

<p>If you want one, you can go in the store and order one. Ask the for the oslo.town logo <em>(they might need to search their emails for a reference file)</em>. Pick out your colour and style of baseball cap. Pay the fine people. And off you go!</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<h2>🙋 FAQ</h2>

<h4>Who actually runs this site?</h4>

<p>The site is run by the user <a href=""https://oslo.town/@matt"">@matt</a> but also pretends to be the character of <a href=""https://oslo.town/@themayor"">@themayor</a>. This is also why everything is in English so far - his Norwegian sucks. Sorry about that.</p>

<h4>Is this linked to Oslo Kommune?</h4>

<p>No. The site is independently run and is not endorsed by Oslo Kommune. The logo of <em>oslo.town</em> is meant to be a parody and tribute to the official Oslo logo, but that is where the link ends. The account <a href=""https://oslo.town/@kommune"">@kommune</a> is not currently maintained or monitored by Oslo Kommune.</p>

<h4>How much does it cost The Mayor to run oslo.town?</h4>

<p>Presently, the main costs are the domain(s), the hosting, and time. But we don't talk about the last one because <a href=""https://oslo.town/@themayor"">@themayor</a> is working on a volunteer basis.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Domains</strong><br />The site is set up on <em>oslo.town</em> which costs 48 GBP per calendar year.</li>
<li><strong>Hosting</strong><br />The hosting is from <em>masto.host</em>. We currently pay 136 USD per month.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing</strong><br />Occasionally, <em>oslo.town</em> prints promotional stickers and cards from <em>moo.com</em> which costs 220 NOK per 100 cards, and 240 NOK per 100 stickers. Postage costs not included.</li>
</ul>

<p>This brings an estimated yearly running cost to a little over 19,000 NOK - which includes domains, hosting, 100 stickers and 100 cards.</p>

<h4>How do you pay for this?</h4>

<p>We take donations. You can donate via <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/oslotown"" title=""Patreon"">Patreon</a>, <a href=""https://ko-fi.com/oslotown"">Ko-Fi</a>, or <a href=""https://paypal.me/mattcoxonline"" title=""PayPal"">PayPal</a>. If you want to <a href=""https://coxy.co/cryptocurrency/"" title=""Send cryptocurrency to coxy"">send cryptocurrency</a>, you can. And if you are using <a href=""https://brave.com/osl041"">Brave Web Browser</a> then you can Tip and Contribute through Brave Rewards as you browse the site.</p>

<p>All donations to to the running cost of oslo.town and other projects listed on the <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/oslotown"" title=""Patreon"">Patreon</a> page. The remaining costs are covered by <a href=""https://oslo.town/@matt"">@matt</a> - who is also <a href=""https://oslo.town/@themayor"" title=""The Mayor of Oslo.town"">@themayor</a>.</p>

<h4>Why should I use this instead of Facebook / Twitter / etc. ?</h4>

<p>Nobody can pretend that <em>oslo.town</em> can replace any popular social networking website, but it's meant to be a nicer alternative. Unlike the big social networking sites, we don't collect your data and sell it. You are not a product. The whole point of this site is <em>community</em> and being able to connect with people locally and globally.</p>

<h4>Is my information private?</h4>

<p>The goal is to collect as little information about the users as possible and that when information is collected, it is stored for as short time as possible. If you care to, you can read the full <a href=""https://oslo.town/terms"">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<p>To protect your privacy even more, please don't share any personal information with anyone on the site. Think carefully about the username you choose. Share only what you are comfortable sharing.</p>

<p>Please consider how long you wish your posts to be available for. Registered users can set up <a href=""https://oslo.town/statuses_cleanup"">Automated Post Deletion</a> which will delete your posts after your chosen number of weeks.</p>

<h4>Do my posts get listed in Google / Bing / another search engine?</h4>

<p>In order to protect your privacy, we have opted-out of listing your profile and toots on search engines. You can turn this on yourself in <a href=""https://oslo.town/settings/preferences/other"">the settings</a>.</p><p>Please be aware that anyone can still screenshot your toots and sites like <em>archive.is</em> or <em>web.archive.org</em> could potentially still create a copy of your publicly listed toots.</p>

<h4>How do I only see languages I understand?</h4>

<p>When you hit the Federated timeline, you will see many users from around the world speaking their native languages. To filter these views to just languages you know, you should <a href=""https://oslo.town/settings/preferences/other"">set up the your language preferences</a>.</p>

<h4>How do I get featured on the Explore page?</h4>

<p>Simple! To get featured on the <a href=""https://oslo.town/explore"">Explore</a> page, just go to <a href=""https://oslo.town/settings/profile"">Edit Profile</a> and check the box which says <em>Suggest account to others</em>.</p>

<h4 id=""blocking"">I see offensive content. Can you block it?</h4>

<p>If you see an account you see posting offensive content, please use the <strong>Block and Report</strong> functionality. If this is content that is not hosted on <em>oslo.town</em> then check the option which says <strong>Forward to...</strong> which will report the account to the appropriate administrator.</p>

<p>Directly from the offensive post, you can also click the option <strong>Block Domain</strong> which will prevent you from seeing any future content from that website.</p>

<p>We have a set of server rules you should follow. In addition to this, the policy at <em>oslo.town</em> is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>We will ensure that bad things don't happen on the <a href=""https://oslo.town/web/timelines/public/local"">Local timeline</a>.</li>
<li>We attempt to hide (but not block) any NSFW or spam content from the <a href=""https://oslo.town/web/timelines/public"">Federated Timeline</a>.</li>
<li>We block any external accounts or domains that are known to frequently spamming our users.</li>
<li>Please allow up to 48 hours to process reports.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, we do not aim to act as your moral compass and will not do domain-wide blocks based on the users of that instance having wild opinions. You should be able to follow anything (even the hidden content) and block these domains or people at your own discretion.</p>

<p>A full list of hidden or blocked domains is published below.</p>

<p>Continuous posting of content or reposting of external content within a short time without intent of engaging in a conversation is not allowed.</p>

<h3 id=""cw"">Content Warnings</h3>

<p>We require all users to properly use Content Warnings (CW) when posting about sensitive, divisive, inflammatory, or upsetting topics and content. These topics include, but are not limited to:<br />
<ul>
<li>Politics</li>
<li>Mature/Sexual/Explicit Content</li>
<li>War/Violence</li>
<li>Disturbing/Hateful Content</li>
<li>Excessive Vulgar/Obscene Language</li>
<li>Child Abuse/Exploitation/Endangerment</li>
<li>Drugs/Gambling/Addictions</li>

</p>

<h3 id=""bots"">Bots/Automated Content</h3>

<p>All bot accounts must have the ""This is a bot account"" box in the profile settings. Any accounts displaying signs of being a bot or strictly posting automated content will be limited or suspended.</p>

<h3 id=""news"">News/Journalism</h3>

<p>While we do allow the discussion of current events and news, accounts found to only be posting links to external news sources without providing any commentary or attempting to start a discussion will be limited or suspended.<br />
<br />
Posting external news links to articles directly related to you (i.e. you are the subject, author, or have some involvement in the article) is allowed.<br />
<br />First and foremost, this community is designed to be a place for discussion so solely reposting news links is not allowed and may also violate our Bots/Automated Content policy above.</p>

<h3 id=""negativity"">The Negativity Clause</h3>
<p>We all have rough days/weeks/months/years, it's okay to rant and vent about life here. It's not always going to be unicorns and rainbows and we understand that. When we say <i>positivity</i> we mean towards each other. As long as you're not complaining about or attacking an individual or group, you're probably fine. 😉 <br />
<br />
Like everywhere else in the world there's going to be arguments and disagreements, heck there will even be people who just can't get along and that's fine. You're not required to agree with or like everybody you meet. We encourage debates and discussions about <strong>topics</strong>, not individuals or persons. So, if you do want to argue or disagree, keep the personal attacks out of it. Thank you.</p>

<h2>Our mission</h2>

<ul>
<li><span style=""color: #353744;"">We have a mission to make </span><span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>mstdn.ca</strong></span><span style=""color: #353744;""> a safe and welcoming environment for everyone regardless of their gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, age, mental or physical disability, political views, and personal appearance.</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: #353744;"">We are resolute in protecting the </span><span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>mstdn.ca</strong></span><span style=""color: #353744;""> community from harassment and malicious content from individual members whose goals are to disrupt our community and promote their own self-interest at the expense of the community.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2>The principles that guide us</h2>

<p><span style=""color: #353744;"">Our Code of Conduct is our north star. It lays out our expected standards of conduct and behaviours that all </span><span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>mstdn.ca</strong></span><span style=""color: #353744;""> users must follow while using this platform.</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span style=""color: #353744;""><strong>We believe that freedom of expression is not freedom of reach.</strong></span><span style=""color: #353744;""> You may say whatever you want, but we reserve the right to keep you from using our platform to say it. Bullies, trolls and disruptors are not welcome in </span><span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>mstdn.ca</strong></span><span style=""color: #353744;""> and neither are users that engage in name-calling, ad-hominem attacks, or other uncivil behaviour. These activities will be actioned accordingly based on our Code of Conduct.</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: #353744;""><strong>This is a voluntary community and you choose to be here.</strong></span><span style=""color: #353744;""> By joining and using this service, you give your tacit agreement to our Code of Conduct and agree to follow it, or risk losing your privilege to access this platform.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2>Code of Conduct | Our server rules</h2>

<ul>
<li><span style=""color: #353744;""><strong>No toxic and hateful speech.</strong></span><span style=""color: #353744;""> We have a zero-tolerance policy on toxic and hateful speech. This includes attacks against anyone&rsquo;s gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, age, disability, personal appearance, or socio-economic status. Discussions related to these topics can be difficult because we don't have similar lived experiences. If you choose to discuss these topics, empathy and kindness are a must, and if you&rsquo;re not able to do so, just mute and move on.</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: #353744;""><strong>No incitement of violence and no promotion of misleading or violent ideologies. </strong></span><span style=""color: #353744;"">You may not make specific threats of violence or physical harm, death, or disease to an individual or group of people. This includes, but is not limited to, threatening or promoting misleading information that may lead to physical harm. You also may not affiliate with organisations that &mdash; whether by their own statements or activity both on and off the platform &mdash; use or promote violence against civilians to further their causes.</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: #353744;""><strong>No harassment, dogpiling, or unwanted advances. </strong></span><span style=""color: #353744;"">You may not continue to engage with a user who has explicitly requested that you stop. This includes consistent baiting, bad-faith gaslighting, unwanted sexual advances, etc.</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: #353744;""><strong>No doxxing of other users. </strong></span><span style=""color: #353744;"">Unauthorised requests for or distribution of any personal information or data is not allowed. Please treat personally identifying information with respect and privacy.</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: #353744;""><strong>No content illegal in Canada or copyrighted content that you don't own rights to. </strong></span><span style=""color: #353744;"">Illegal or copyrighted content is not allowed to be stored, posted, or discussed on mstdn.ca&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: #353744;""><strong>Sexually explicit or violent media must be marked appropriately.</strong></span><span style=""color: #353744;""> Posts and images with sexually explicit or violence must be flagged as sensitive and contain a content warning noting either &lsquo;NSFW&rsquo; or &lsquo;Violence&rsquo; when posting. Users may not have sexually explicit or violent media as a profile photo or header image. There are also types of sensitive media content that we don&rsquo;t allow at all, including violent sexual conduct, gratuitous gore, and hateful imagery. We prohibit violent sexual conduct to prevent the normalization of sexual assault and non-consensual violence associated with sexual acts. We prohibit gratuitous gore content because research has shown that repeated exposure to violent content online may negatively impact an individual&rsquo;s well-being.</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: #353744;""><strong>No spamming.</strong></span><span style=""color: #353744;""> Excessive posting, boosting, advertising or mass-marketing posts will be actioned accordingly and based on intent.</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: #353744;""><strong>Be yourself. </strong></span><span style=""color: #353744;"">Accounts intended to impersonate or parody are not permitted, and those found to be directly misrepresenting themselves as another person or entity will be actioned accordingly. General parody accounts like Beaverton or CBC Pitchbot are allowed as they are not impersonating a person or entity.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2>Community guidelines | Our norms</h2>

<p><span style=""color: #353744;"">The list below is a collection of norms and behaviours that will help us build a community that we all want to participate in. While these best practices are designed to be guidelines for a good communal instance, repeated malicious unwillingness to follow the best practices will be considered just like breaking a rule (it&rsquo;s all about intent).</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span style=""color: #353744;""><strong>We are not an advertising platform.</strong></span><span style=""color: #353744;""> If you are here only to sell your products or services, you will be removed. Occasional posts of commercial links are acceptable, but if the vast majority of a user's posts are commercial in nature, we will regard the account as a spam account. Moderators will evaluate reports of spam on a case-by-case basis.</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: #353744;""><strong>Do not report every post that upsets you.</strong></span><span style=""color: #353744;""> Please report posts that violate our Code of Conduct. For other posts that you find distasteful or don&rsquo;t like but don&rsquo;t violate the rules, use the mute, filter, or block functionality. Let the moderation team focus on the real problematic posts.</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: #353744;""><strong>Be considerate.</strong></span><span style=""color: #353744;""> In general, use the tools provided to foster a considerate and accessible atmosphere. This includes the liberal use of:</span></li>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: #353744;"">Content warnings (CWs) are a kind way to let people choose to opt-out of potentially disturbing or controversial topics like spoilers or triggering/traumatic posts. CWs are also mandatory on posts containing gore, violence, or NSFW. If in doubt, err on the side of caution.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: #353744;"">Alt-text captioning of media files can help our vision-impaired community members join in on the discussion. Alt-text is needed for those who rely upon screen readers to read what's on their screen. Without this, screen readers can't describe images to those who can't see them.</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: #353744;"">#CamelCase use of hashtags can help screen readers read the hashtags properly.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><li><span style=""color: #353744;""><strong>Give credit where it&rsquo;s due.</strong></span><span style=""color: #353744;""> When possible, provide credit for creative works in your posts that are not your own.</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: #353744;""><strong>Don&rsquo;t be a creep.</strong></span><span style=""color: #353744;""> Uninvited comments about another user&#39;s personal choices, lifestyle or family are strongly discouraged and may be considered harassment.</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: #353744;""><strong>Be respectful.</strong></span><span style=""color: #353744;""> In discussions, please remain civil, and do not insult the person you&#39;re talking to. Note that irony, sarcasm, or similar modes of language don&#39;t translate well to written language and tend to escalate discussions or misunderstandings. Criticize ideas, not people.</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: #353744;""><strong>Boosts are endorsements.</strong></span><span style=""color: #353744;""> You are responsible for what you boost. If you boost content that doesn&#39;t comply with our rules, moderators may take action.</span></li>
</ul>

<li><span style=""color: #353744;"">Posts from the bot account must be &quot;unlisted&quot;.</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: #353744;"">Must enable &quot;Automated post deletion&quot; with a maximum age threshold of one month, with the exception of pinned posts and direct messages. Exceptions based on interactions are not eligible.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""color: #353744;"">Bots that do not follow the above policy will be suspended.</span></p>
<h2>Truth and reconciliation</h2>
<p><span style=""color: #353744;"">The mstdn.ca team acknowledges that the areas where we work, live, and play, span across many Territories and Treaty areas and we are exceedingly grateful for the traditional Knowledge Keepers and Elders who are with us today, those who have gone before us, and the youth that inspire us.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #353744;"">We recognize the land and the benefits it provides all of us, as an act of Reconciliation, and as recommended by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission&rsquo;s (TRC) 94 Calls to Action, and give gratitude to those whose territory we reside on, work on or are visiting.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #353744;"">We are committed to continuing to learn, evolve and grow to ensure we are aligned with Indigenous-led Reconciliation frameworks.</span></p>

<h2>Open-source social networking</h2>
<p><span style=""color: #353744;"">Follow friends and discover new ones among more than 4.5M people. Publish anything you want: links, pictures, text, and video. All on a platform that is community-owned and ad-free.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #353744;"">Mastodon isn&rsquo;t just a website, it is a federation&mdash;think Star Trek. Thousands of independent communities running Mastodon form a coherent network, where while every planet is different, being part of one is being part of the whole.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #353744;"">Mastodon comes with effective anti-abuse tools to help protect yourself. Thanks to the network&#39;s spread out and independent nature there are more moderators who you can approach for personal help and servers with strict codes of conduct.</span></p>
<h2>Convenient sharing</h2>
<p><span style=""color: #353744;"">You have 500 characters. You can adjust the thumbnails of your pictures with focal points. You can use custom emojis, hide things behind spoiler warnings and choose who sees a given post. Messed it up? You can edit the post or even delete &amp; redraft it for quick corrections.</span></p>
<h2>Mastodon for all</h2>
<p><span style=""color: #353744;"">Without an incentive to sell you things, Mastodon allows you to consume the content you enjoy uninterrupted. Your feed is chronological, ad-free and non-algorithmic &mdash; you decide who you want to see!</span></p>
<h2>Questions? Comments?</h2>

<p><a href=""https://h4.io/"">h4.io</a> est une instance Mastodon française et généraliste où le respect et la convivialité sont les maîtres mots ! 👋</p>

<p>Inscrivez-vous, présentez-vous et n’hésitez pas à partager vos passions, centres d’intérêts, pensées du moment. Nous cherchons à créer un endroit simplement convivial. ☺️</p>

<p>Comme en tout endroit civilisé, les règles de courtoisies et d&#39;éducations élémentaires s&#39;appliquent ici. Les règles seront amenées à évoluer si nécessaire. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Modération</h2>

<p>Nous modérons activement <a href=""https://h4.io/"">h4.io</a> afin d&#39;être un endroit accueillant. Chaque personne doit pouvoir se sentir accueillie et en sécurité ici, et nous ferons tout pour que ça reste le cas.</p>

<p>Tout comportement allant à l&#39;encontre de ces valeurs, dénigrant des minorités, tenant des propos racistes, fascistes, homophobes, sexistes (etc) où ne respectant pas nos règles sera sanctionné.</p>

<p>Vous disposez de la possibilité de <a href=""https://h4.io/settings/migration"">migrer votre compte sur une autre instance</a> si vous n&#39;êtes pas en phase avec cela.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Cross-postage</h2>

<p>Nous avons décidé de bloquer le cross-postage, aka le fait de publier sur Twitter et que cela soit également publié sur notre instance Mastodon.</p>

<p>La raison est que bien souvent, les comptes utilisant ce procédé finissent par ne poster que sur Twitter, ne lisent pas les réponses et n&#39;ont aucune interactions avec le reste de l&#39;instance.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Informations techniques</h2>

<p>Nous sommes hébergés en France, chez Scaleway, sur différentes machines virtuelles :
<ul>
  <li>Cœur de Mastodon : instance DEV-L (8 Go de Ram / 4 vCPUs X86 64bit)</li>
  <li>Base de donnée : instance PostgreSQL managée</li>
  <li>Stockage : Object Storage de Scaleway</li>
  <li>Cloudflare en tant que CDN</li>
  <li>Mailgun pour l&#39;envoie des emails</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Nous partageons ces informations car elles ne présentent pas un risque de sécurité particulier, parce que nous souhaitons être transparent avec l&#39;infrastructure gérant vos données mais aussi pour renseigner et aider les administrateurs d&#39;instances cherchant à s&#39;informer sur ce sujet.</p>

<p>Enfin, nous maintenons gratuitement cette instance Mastodon qui est une porte d&#39;entrée sur le Fediverse, cependant nous vous recommandons d&#39;exporter régulièrement vos données. Nous sommes -comme tout le monde, comme notre hébergeur- sujet à des soucis techniques exceptionnels, nous ne pourrons être tenu responsables en cas d&#39;indisponibilité ou perte de données.</p>

<p>This place was built by people of the Brazilian TECH community that believes we can change our Country; we seek to live in a fair country, without misery, racism, corruption, homophobia, hunger, inequality, a place to include, a humanized space, with human rights for all humans. These are our values.</p>

<p>Here we like to talk about IaC, CI/CD, Dev, Ops, Network, Platforms, Software Engineering, DevOps, GitOps, Containers, Kubernetes, Cloud, and Cloud Native.</p>

<p>This is a Fediverse corner for Geeks, Nerds, Otakus, and tech enthusiasts. Besides the TECH topics, we also like to talk about life, the universe, and everything else.</p>

<p>This is a <b>moderated instance</b>. Our space intent to include everyone, especially minority groups. We are a feminist, anti-fascist, anti-nazi, anti-racist, anti-colonialist community. We are pro-science and pro-LGBTQIA+ and will try our best to be a warm, safe and inclusive space.</p>

<p>Our core values are democracy, social inclusion, digital inclusion, open standards, and the use of open-source software.</p>

<p>We love open-source and prefer to use it, but we also talk about other kinds of tech with different licenses and scopes.</p>

<p>To keep this place safe and healthy, all users should follow our rules, code of conduct, and anti-harassment policy.
</p>

<p>Our moderation will work to keep this space safe. Depending on the severity, if they found any post offending our rules, the author could be silenced or suspended.</p>

<h3>Uso de Crossposters</h3>

<ul>

<li>Posts vindos de outras redes, como o Twitter, ainda precisam obedecer à outras regras desse código, tais como avisos de conteúdo.</li>
<li>Se possivel use tags para filtar oq você deseja enviar para twitter ou mastodon.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Uso de Bots</h3>

<p>Se quiser subir bots use instancias feitas para essa finalidade.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<h2>Outras Informações</h2>

<h3>Como reportar uma violação do código de conduta</h3>

<p>O Mastodon possui ferramentas internas de denúncia. Qualquer post ou perfil que você acredite que esteja em violação dessas regras pode ser denunciado utilizando a ferramenta interna do Mastodon e ele será enviado aos moderadores.</p>

<p>Caso a sua denúncia seja relativa a um dos moderadores, você pode reportar a violação através de mensagem direta à um dos outros moderadores.</p>

<p>Você pode fazer uma denúncia mesmo que a sua situação não seja diretamente coberta por essas regras, caso a situação lhe cause desconforto. A moderação irá avaliar cada situação individualmente.</p>

<p>Respondemos de maneira privada à todas as denúncias que recebemos, fazendo um esforço para que a primeira resposta seja dada nas primeiras 24 horas.</p>

<p>Caso queira, pode entrar em contato pelos e-mails abaixo</p>

<p>Entre em contato caso precise de ajuda:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""denuncia@bolha.us"">denuncia at bolha.us</a></li>
<li><a href=""abuse@bolha.us"">abuse at bolha.us</a></li>
<li><a href=""violacao@bolha.us"">violacao at bolha.us</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Esses e-mails são aliases para uma mesma conta.</p>

<h3>Entenda os níveis de privacidade</h3>

<p>No Mastodon cada status pode ser postado em quatro diferentes configurações de audiência. É importante ter isso em mente porque certas regras só se aplicam a algumas configurações e não a outras:</p>

<ul>
<li>PÚBLICA: A publicação aparece no feed dos seus seguidores, na página pública do seu perfil, na busca por hashtags, no feed local (compartilhado pelos demais membros da instância) e no feed federado (compartilhado por todas as instâncias federadas).</li>
<li>NÃO LISTADA: A publicação aparece no feed dos seus seguidores e na página pública do seu perfil. Porém, não é listada (não aparece) em buscas por hashtags, nem no feed local, nem no feed federado.</li>
<li>SOMENTE SEGUIDORES: A publicação aparece apenas no feed dos seus seguidores. Porém, não aparece na página pública do seu perfil, nem em buscas por hashtags, nem no feed local, nem no feed federado.</li>
<li>MENSAGEM DIRETA: A publicação aparece apenas no feed das pessoas marcadas por você.</li>
</ul>

<p>ATENÇÃO: Mensagens diretas não devem ser confundidas com mensagens privadas, pois o Mastodon não é uma ferramenta projetada para a troca segura de mensagens criptografadas de ponta a ponta.</p>

<p>Os moderadores da instância podem acessar todas as mensagens publicadas a qualquer momento e o farão em casos de denúncias. Leia a nossa política sobre mensagens diretas mais adiante.</p>

<h3>Sobre mensagens diretas</h3>

<p><b>Mensagens diretas não são mensagens privadas.</b></p>

<p>O Mastodon não é uma ferramenta projetada para a troca segura de mensagens criptografadas de ponta a ponta. Tenha em mente que os moderadores podem acessar a qualquer momento todas as mensagens publicadas na instância, inclusive as mensagens com audiência reduzida (mensagens diretas), e o farão sempre que houver alguma denúncia.</p>

<p>Os moderadores da Bolha pactuam dois compromissos com a comunidade em relação às mensagens com audiência reduzida (mensagens diretas):</p>

<p>Os moderadores da Bolha acessarão o conteúdo de mensagens diretas sempre que e exclusivamente nos casos em que algum dos usuários citados em uma mensagem direta denuncie a publicação ou seu autor.</p>

<p>Os moderadores da Bolha não acessarão o conteúdo de mensagens diretas em nenhum outro caso, sob pena desta ação ser analisada pelos demais moderadores podendo ser punidos com suspensão ou até banimento por quebra de confiança.</p>

<p>Não recomendamos que você utilize o Mastodon para transmitir informações sensíveis ou sigilosas, esse não é um espaço para isso.</p>

<p>Caso você tenha a necessidade de trocar mensagens com privacidade e segurança, recomendamos o uso de ferramentas e de protocolos abertos que tenham sido desenvolvidas com software livre e que sigam o estado da arte dos protocolos criptográficos públicos. Tais como o mensageiro instantâneo <a href=""https://signal.org"">Signal</a> ou o utilitário de criptografia <a href=""https://www.openpgp.org/"">OpenPGP</a>.</p>

Users here can connect with one another <em>and the millions of other Mastodon users</em> who have opted for social media that is ad-free and actively moderated to keep bad actors at bay. Here&#39;s how to get started.</p>

<h2>1. Create an account</h2>

<p><a href=""/auth/sign_up"" target='_blank'>Create an account</a> 
to get started. You&#39;ll be asked to agree to some ground rules. You can post about almost anything on sciences.social, but we don&#39;t allow sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, casteism or abusive behavior. </p>

<p>Once you confirm your email you&#39;ll be online. Come on back to this page (<a href=""/about"">sciences.social/about</a>) for next steps.</p>

<h2>2. Get an app</h2>

<p><a href=""https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ice-cubes-for-mastodon/id6444915884"">Ice Cubes for iOS</a> and <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keylesspalace.tusky"">Tusky for Android</a> are very good and free. <a href=""https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mona-for-mastodon/id1659154653"">Mona</a> and  <a href=""https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ivory-for-mastodon-by-tapbots/id6444602274"">ivory</a> are excellent apps for iOS/Mac users with a few dollars to spare.</p>

<p>Mastodon also works well from a web browser on laptops and desktops. A browser extension like Graze (<a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/graze-for-mastodon/epocinhmkcnjfjobnglchpbncndobblj"">chrome</a>, <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/graze/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search"">mozilla</a>) or FediAct (<a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fediact/lmpcajpkjcclkjbliapfjfolocffednm"">chrome</a>, <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fediact/"">mozilla</a>) will make following folks from other Mastodon servers seamless. Highly recommended.</p>

<h2>3. Follow lots of folks</h2>

<p>Thousands of social scientists are active on Mastodon, and you can follow anyone regardless of which server they call home. There&#39;s no algorithm to fill your feed with content so it helps to follow liberally. Our companion site <strong><a href=""https://find.sciences.social"">find.sciences.social</a></strong> makes it easy to find and follow academics from many different disciplines including <a href=""https://find.sciences.social/search?field=sociology"">Sociology</a>, <a href=""https://find.sciences.social/search?q=&field=communication-and-media-studies"">Communication and Media Studies</a>, and <a href=""https://find.sciences.social/search?q=&field=political-scientists"">Political Science</a>. <a href=""https://followgraph.vercel.app/"">Followgraph</a> finds folks who are popular among the people you already follow.</p>

<p>You can also follow hashtags like <a href=""/tags/ASA2023"">#ASA2023</a> to see what people are posting about the conference. Or follow <a href=""/tags/rstats"">#rstats</a> for hints on R and <a href=""/tags/academicchatter"">#AcademicChatter</a> for - you know. Or maybe just <a href=""/tags/naturephotography"">#NaturePhotography</a> for some pleasant views.</p>

<h2>4. Start Posting and Boosting</h2>

<p>Introduce yourself with your first post, and include an <a href=""/tags/introduction"">#introduction</a> hashtag. Post about whatever you want, and use hashtags to make finding your posts easier. If you see a post you like, boost it. There&#39;s no algorithm to amplify selected voices here so we rely on boosting to see what&#39;s interesting.</p>

<h1>More about us</h1>

<p><em>sciences.social</em> welcomes all social scientists, including professors, grad students and anyone with a graduate degree in the social sciences (sociology, anthropology, political science, communications, economics...), including people who are doing qualitative and quantitative work inside or outside academia.  We want this to be a comfortable place for social scientists from all backgrounds, including those who are from marginalized or racialized groups, sexual minorities, people with disabilities and others who may not feel welcomed in some academic spaces. </p>

<p><em>sciences.social</em> is collectively funded. It was started by <a href=""http://www.markigra.com/"">Mark Igra</a> (<a href=""https://sciences.social/@markigra"">@markigra</a>), a PhD student who earned enough money to start the site in a previous career. While Mark will continue to ensure sciences.social is funded, donations have helped pay for the rapid growth of the site. <strong>We encourage you to donate</strong> through our <a href=""https://opencollective.com/sciences-social"">Open Collective fundraising page</a>, which shows all of our spending. Donations through that page are tax deductible for U.S. taxpayers thanks to fiscal hosting from the <a href=""https://opencollective.com"">Open Collective Foundation</a>.</p>

<p>Mark runs this site with the help of a crew of moderators (<a href=""https://sciences.social/@pratik"">Pratik</a>, <a href=""https://sciences.social/@koerselman"">Kristian</a>, <a href=""https://sciences.social/@simonlindgren"">Simon</a> and <a href=""https://sciences.social/@jicastij"">Javier</a>), with valuable advice from folks like <a href=""https://sciences.social/@emlinne"">Emily</a> and <a href=""https://sciences.social/@pamelaoliver"">Pamela</a>. Let us know if you would like to help out.</p>

<h3>Policies</h3>

<p>At the moment, the official rules are deliberately minimal, but they have important implications. First, if you don&#39;t understand that &quot;treat people with respect&quot; means no sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia or casteism and precludes abusive behavior and doxxing, then you don&#39;t belong on this site. Second, you must use your real name in your profile and we strongly encourage using your full name as your display name. While there are plenty of good reasons for anonymity on the internet, for our purposes being able to link online reputation to real-world reputation is important.</p>

<h3>Post Visibility</h3>

<p>Public posts appear on the local timelines and federated timelines of sciences.social and all other mastodon instances that host your followers. Consider using Unlisted for posts you want your followers to see, but would prefer not to appear in public timelines. <strong>Using Unlisted for replies is strongly encouraged.</strong></p>

<p>Posts expressing racism, homophobia and the like are not allowed with or without a content warning or with any level of visibility.</p>

<h3>Sensitive Media</h3>

<p>You must mark media as sensitive if it contains violence or sexual content. We also request that you mark media as sensitive if it might trigger common phobias including arachnophobia (fear of spiders) and Ophidiophobia (fear of snakes).</p>

<h3>Getting along</h3>

<p>Folks come here from different academic, ethnic and national cultures, so there are likely to be some mismatches in tone when we talk to one another. People might be more blunt than you are used to, or you might think someone is frustratingly obtuse when they are just trying to be polite. It&#39;s best to presume that folks here are acting in good faith. Mastodon has good tools for filtering or blocking posts you don&#39;t want to see. However, if you think someone is deliberately violating the rules or negatively affecting the community as a whole, you can report them as described below.</p>

<h3>Reporting bad behavior</h3>

<p>One of the great strengths of Mastodon is the ability to restrict access to bad actors. sciences.social already blocks posts from dozens of sites known to host trolls and nazis, but there&#39;ll be other bad behavior. If you use the &quot;Report&quot; action on someone&#39;s post the moderators can review it and take action to restrict that account. Reporting helps even for people who make their home on other servers.</p>

<h3>Content Warnings</h3>

<p>Content warnings are an important part of both the technical infrastructure and the culture of the Mastodon online community. They aren&#39;t just used for &quot;triggering&quot; content but also are often treated as a “headline” that allows people to choose whether they want to read the whole post. Click the CW link on your post to set one.</p>

<p>We strongly encourage the use of content warnings for posts that you think might be triggering or of limited interest, for example mentions of death or violence, and political debates centered on one country or locality.</p>

<p>While expressions of racism, casteism, homophobia, and transphobia are off-limits, we do not require content warnings for posts <em>about</em> those topics and their effects on people, whether academic or otherwise. Use your own judgment about using content warnings on these topics.</p>

<h2>Site Visualization</h2>

<p>The current header image is a public domain visualization from <a href=""https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/w-e-b-du-bois-hand-drawn-infographics-of-african-american-life-1900"">W.E.B. Du Bois exhibit at the 1900 Paris Exhibition</a>. Expect changing visualizations over time</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Les serveurs « limités » voient l&#39;ensemble de leurs comptes limités : un compte limité est caché à tous les autres utilisateurs de l&#39;instance, à l&#39;exception de ceux qui le suivent. Tout le contenu est toujours présent et peut être trouvé par le biais de la recherche, des mentions et du suivi, mais le contenu est invisible publiquement.</p></li>
<li><p>Les serveurs « suspendus » voient l&#39;ensemble de leurs comptes suspendus : un compte suspendu n&#39;apparaît plus dans les recherches, sa page de profil a disparu, tous ses messages, ses téléchargements, ses followers et toutes les autres données sont supprimées. Cependant, cette suspension n&#39;est effective que dans un sens : le serveur suspendu peut encore accéder au contenu non privé de ce serveur.</p></li>

<p>Un serveur pourra être limité, par exemple, si il ne respecte pas les règles sur l’étiquetage de la pornographie et de la nudité comme « NSFW », ou l’étiquetage des contenus sensibles/choquants avec un « Content Warning » approprié.</p>

<p>Un serveur pourra être suspendu, par exemple, si ses membres, de manière systémique, harcèlent d’autres utilisateurs ou utilisatrices, incluant, sans s’y limiter, les menaces de toute sorte, les insultes, les blagues et le langage discriminatoires, les attentions sexuelles importunes, la publication d’informations d’identification personnelle (“doxing”), ou perturbent délibérément des discussions ou des membres via du trolling, du spam, du flaming, du baiting, de la recherche d’attention, de la distribution de malware, ou tout type d’attaque contre l’infrastructure informatique du projet Sciences.Re ou de ses organisations collaboratrices. </p>

<p>Avant de procéder à une suspension de serveur, un délai raisonnable est laissé au serveur pour lui permettre de modérer le contenu de son côté, après une demande de modération effectuée par l&#39;équipe de modération de Sciences.Re. En absence de réaction au terme de ce délai raisonnable, le serveur sera suspendu.</p>

<p>Il est possible de proposer des serveurs à suspendre ou à limiter aux modérateurs de l&#39;instance, joignables via le compte @contact@sciences.re ; toute demande argumentée sera considérée. </p>

</ol>

<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>We intend to protect all members of our community from harassment and to ensure that our community is as welcoming and inclusive as possible. This document contains the rules and principles for participating in our platform. This is a working document, so our team may amend it from time to time.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<ul>
<li>Provide a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for everyone regardless of gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, political affiliation, or other similar characteristics.</li>
<li>Create a supportive community where people freely share their passions and are excited and optimistic about each other&#39;s successes.</li>
<li>Protect our community from harassment, malicious or illegal content, and individual members whose goals are to disrupt our community and promote their own self-interest at the expense of the community.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Principles that Guide us</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>We are not a free speech zone.</strong> This CoC lays out expected standards of conduct and behavior. You cannot say or post anything violating these rules or principles and remain a community member. You must follow this CoC. If you are looking for something else, please do. It is not here.</li>
<li><strong>The Moderators are not morality or thought police.</strong> Moderators are guided by this Code of Conduct. Post what you want if what you post follows these rules, principles, and the goals outlined above. Not every community member will appreciate controversial or explicit posts, so use Content Warnings liberally. We use Content Warnings so community members themselves can decide whether they want to see or engage with a post that may be controversial or explicit.</li>
<li><strong>Bullies, trolls, and disruptors</strong> are not welcome in our community. We will moderate accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>This is a voluntary community. You chose to be here.</strong> When you decide to join, you have implied that you agree with this Code of Conduct and will follow it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rules for posting</h2>

<p>The rules you need to follow if you want to be a member of our community are stated below.</p>

<h2>General guidance on posting and participating in this community</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Do not post about inflammatory, controversial subjects without a Content Warning.</strong> Ideally, you would not post about provocative topics at all. However, it may be acceptable to do so in some cases. Still, posting inflammatory content without hiding the content behind an appropriate Content Warning is never good.</li>
<li><strong>Do not post any nudity without a Content Warning.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Regarding Spam: We are not your free advertising platform.</strong> You will be removed if you are here only to sell your products or services. Occasional posts of commercial links are OK, but when most of a user&#39;s posts are commercial, we regard the account as Spam account. Moderators will evaluate reports of Spam on a case-by-case basis.</li>
<li><strong>Do not engage in name-calling</strong>, <a href=""https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ad%20hominem"">ad hominem attacks</a>, or other uncivil behavior. Criticize ideas, never people.</li>
<li><strong>Do not report every post that upsets you.</strong> Please report posts that violate our rules but for others that you may find distasteful or don&#39;t like, use the tools available to you. You can block the user or mute the conversation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Moderation Principles</h2>

<p>Reported content will be assessed on a balance of probabilities by the moderators. In other words, whether it&#39;s more likely than not that the content violates one or more of these rules. Moderators will suspend an account from this community when the user demonstrates that they have breached any rule several times or if their content (including profile description) suggests that they are likely to continue to break the rules. The number of breaches leading to suspension is deliberately not defined. In egregious cases, one violation can result in suspending the user account.</p>

<p>The moderation team takes a pragmatic approach to every report they receive - if they feel that a problematic post isn&#39;t explicitly a breach of any of these rules but is inappropriate for this community, the post will likely be removed. Users who repeatedly post problematic content or are seen by the moderators as a negative, disruptive presence in our community can be removed at the moderation team&#39;s discretion, even if those posts or the user did not explicitly violate our rules.</p>

<h1>Reporting and moderation</h1>
<br><br>
When reporting accounts, please make sure to include at least a few posts that show rule-breaking behaviour, when applicable. If there is any additional context that might help make a decision, please also include it in the comment. This is especially important when the content is in a language nobody on the moderation team speaks.
<br><br>
We usually handle reports within 24 hours. Please mind that you are not notified when a report you have made has led to punitive action and that not all punitive actions are externally visible. For first-time offences, we may opt to delete offending content, escalating to harsher measures on repeat offences.

<p>Want to donate to us? <a href=""https://opencollective.com/urbanistssocial"">Check out our Open Collective here!</a></p>

<p>We generally align ourself with the policies and goals of other instances like <a href=""https://mastodon.social"">mastodon.social</a>, <a href=""https://awoo.space/"">awoo.space</a>, and <a href=""icosahedron.website"">icosahedron.website</a>. We want our server to be a safe space for our users. Generally the rules boil down to ""don't be a dick"", but a few worth drawing attention to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Any content that is illegal under US or EU law is prohibited</b>. We're run by a small community, please don't get us in trouble.</li>
  <li>No racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, and any other discriminatory conduct that attacks any individual or group of individuals based on what they are or what they believe is strictly forbidden. This excludes shitting on drivers, but still try to be nice.</li>
  <li>Any conduct that abuses this Mastodon instance, or any other Mastodon instance, is strictly forbidden.</li>
  <li>Your user profile (including your name and display name) must be SWF. NSFW content is not banned, but please be sure to tag it appropriately.</li>
  <li>Please be considerate and respectful of others. Consider adding content warnings to your posts about controversial subjects or commonly-held phobias.</li>
  <li><b>No harassment.</b> Harassment is any improper or unwelcome conduct that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation to another person.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our admins on this server are <a href=""https://urbanists.social/@sam"">@sam</a> and <a href=""https://urbanists.social/@zak"">@zak</a>.</p>

<p>This is not Twitter. <b>Reporting posts that make you feel uncomfortable, or that you feel should be brought to our attention, is highly encouraged</b>. Your reports will not be ignored, and will be dealt with (usually) within a few days. It may take more than a week due to timezone differences or jobs, but you will always hear back about your report, and it won't be closed until you're happy with the resolution for the report. If your report involves a user or post on another instance, you have the choice of sharing your report with the administration of that instance as well, but the report will always be sent to us. Please include in the report whether you chose to send the report to the other instance, though.</p>

<p>No moderation actions are automatic whatsoever. Nothing happens without human review.</p>

<p><a href=""https://joinmastodon.org/covenant""><b>We follow the Mastodon server covenant.</b></a> If we decide to close the server, we will give you <em>minimum</em> three months notice. Our hosting provider, <a href=""https://masto.host/"">masto.host</a>, does daily backups of our database.</p>

<h2>Defederation policy</h2>

<p>Defederation occurs when we limit access to other Mastodon instances. We do this through <em>domain blocks</em>, where we silence or suspend other servers by their domain name. <em>Silencing</em> an instance will make all posts from all accounts on the instance invisible to anyone who isn't following them on our server. <em>Suspending</em> will remove all of the instance’s content and media, and will not allow you to follow any users there.</p>

<p>We use domain blocks to keep our server safe, to pressure other instances to moderate more effectively, and to decrease the amount of moderation of remote content we have to do. We monitor the <span class=""externalcitation"">[#Fediblock]</span>(<a class=""autolink"" href=""https://urbanists.social/tags/FediBlock"">https://urbanists.social/tags/FediBlock</a>) for reports from users and admins for troublesome accounts and instances. </p>

<p>We don’t yet have a specific set of rules we follow when blocking instances, but generally this is our policy:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Any instance whose purpose, stated goals, or moderation rules conflict with any of our rules are immediately suspended</strong>. Fairly self-explanatory. We don’t want this content on our server.

<ul>
<li>Example: We do not allow promotion of crypto. Cryptodon clearly breaks this rule and it has been suspended.</li>
<li>Another example: There are multiple instances for TERFs. We do not allow TERFs or ‘gender critical’ bullshit on our server, so multiple TERF sites have been suspended.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Instances that do not have adequate prohibition of hate speech or harassment are immediately suspended</strong>.

<ul>
<li>A large percentage of these instances are ‘free speech’ servers with little to no rules. Remaining federated with these instances opens our users to a high possibility of receiving abuse from them.</li>
<li>Example: Gab does not have adequate rules against hate speech. It’s an alt-right hellhole known for harassing lots of minorities in the Fediverse. So it has been suspended.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Instances with admins that engage in hate speech or harassment are immediately suspended</strong>.

<ul>
<li>Admins that do this are not capable of moderating hate speech or harassment, point blank. We do not want our users to be subject to their users’ harassment or hate speech.</li>
<li>Example: Alex Gleason is a well-known TERF who regularly posts hate speech and harassment on his servers. This behavior attracts more TERFs to his servers who engage in the same behavior. As a result, all instances Gleason runs are suspended on our server.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Instances that are on lots of our peers’ block lists are very likely to be suspended.</strong>

<ul>
<li>We trust the admin work of our peer instances, especially those that are larger than our own server. As a server that hasn’t received a lot of abuse, we like to prevent it before it happens. Watching other instances’ block lists is key to making this happen.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Instances reported on <span class=""hashtag"">#FediBlock</span> are very likely to be silenced or suspended.</strong>

<ul>
<li>If we get repeat reports about an instance on the <span class=""externalcitation"">[#FediBlock]</span>(<a class=""autolink"" href=""https://urbanists.social/tags/FediBlock"">https://urbanists.social/tags/FediBlock</a>) hashtag, we are very likely to take action against that instance. A high frequency of these reports from multiple users usually indicates a good candidate for a domain block.</li>
<li>Example: The admin of <a class=""autolink"" href=""https://journa.host"">journa.host</a> has been the subject of numerous complaints on the FediBlock tag. As a result of this, they have been silenced. This prevents our users from receiving random harassment from their users, while also allowing our users to follow users on the server.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Instances with questionable moderation are highly likely to be silenced or suspended</strong>.

<ul>
<li>Example: <a class=""autolink"" href=""https://c.im"">c.im</a> bans exactly one server. They’ve received numerous complaints on <span class=""hashtag"">#FediBlock</span> due to their admin not moderating content effectively. As a result of this, we’ve silenced their server.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Instances on Probation</h2>

<p>Users have requested the following instances to be unblocked, and the admins have reviewed them and put them on a probation list. We'll take any reports against these instances seriously and we'll be more likely to block them again.</p>

<p>In January 2024, the admins and sponsors of this instance declared their intention to stop this instance.
In order to keep it alive nonetheless, the team behind Mastodon Belgium offered to migrate this instance to their infrastructure to keep it alive.
This migration is now nearly complete.</p>

<p>The team behind this Mastodon Instance is committed to bring you the best possible experience of the decentralized Twitter alternative called Mastodon. This instance is provided mainly for those who live in the Benelux area. But others who live in other countries are welcome too! As long as they keep their public posts in Dutch, French, German, or English to make moderation easier among other things. We - the admins of mastodon.vlaanderen -  want to aim for a &#39;localized&#39; experience for our (Benelux) users as much as possible.</p>

<h3>(Financial) contributions</h3>

<p>It&#39;s possible to contribute (financially) to this instance. This can be done by a (recurring) donation and/or becoming a moderator.</p>

<h4>Becoming a moderator</h4>

<p>You can discuss this with the admin @admin@mastodon.vlaanderen or by sending an e-mail to hello[at]mastodon.vlaanderen</p>

<h4>Donations</h4>

<p>This server runs entirely on donations. We do not serve targeted ads and we do not sell your data as you can read in our <a href=""https://mastodon.vlaanderen/privacy-policy"">Privacy Policy</a>. </p>

<p>There are several ways you can do a (recurring) donation.</p>

<ul>
<li>Via  <a href=""https://paypal.me/mastondonbelgium?country.x=BE&locale.x=nl_NL"">PayPal</a></li>
<li>Via a bank transfer: <strong>BE11 7351 3917 1948</strong> with &quot;Mastodon Vlaanderen&quot; as the description</li>
<li>Via <a href=""https://opencollective.com/mastodon-vlaanderen"">OpenCollective</a>. A similar platform to <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/"">Patreon</a> but with the choice that you can freely choose the amount you want to donate. Recurring or not. </li>
</ul>

<p>Recurring donations are preferred over one-time donations, because hosting this platform is also a recurring cost.</p>

<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>We expect all users that are using our instance to adhere to our rules and Code of Conduct and agree to our Terms Of Service listed below. Those guidelines are not a legal document, but they are here to provide you with an insight into our content and moderation policies. The final interpretation/decision is up to the administrators of mastodon.vlaanderen. </p>

<h3>Guidelines for other Fediverse instances</h3>

<p>All users that interact with our instance from another instance must also follow an &quot;common sense&quot; practice and the admin(s) and moderators must have a good and active moderation policy. We will limit or block an entire instance if they do not have such policies in place, hosting illegal and/or abusive material, ... etc. You can find which instances we block/limit on our about page. </p>

<p>If you are an instance admin and believe we unjustly block/limit your instance. Send an e-mail to hello[at]mastodon.vlaanderen. </p>

<h2>Terms of Service</h2>

<h3>Usage by (commercial) entities</h3>

<p>Entities commercial or not are allowed on this instance. Although we recommend setting up your own instance for a variety of reasons. Setting up a Mastodon instance is not that hard nowadays since the existence of services that serves you managed Mastodon instances and do the maintenance for you. They have also better uptime guarantees and SLA (Service Level Agreement) than the average Mastodon instance that are mostly run by individuals just like this one. Which is important if your brand (heavily) relies on social media.</p>

<p>If you want more information about this matter. Consult the @admin or send an e-mail. We can help you out finding a good instance for you. </p>

<p>If you still want to join this instance, there are some guidelines/rules you must follow. To make validation easier. </p>

<ul>
<li>You must have an Belgian VAT number on your website and/or being based in Belgium</li>
<li>Signup with your brand&#39;s e-mail domain like social@yourbrand.be and not with a public e-mail service like Gmail.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Usage by famous/well-known/public people</h3>

<p>Well-known people are allowed to use this instance. But keep in mind that we can ask you to verify yourself if we suspect that the signed up account was made by an impersonator without a clear view that it is a parody account.</p>

<p>We can ask you to provide one of these for the verification process: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>a government issued ID</p></li>
<li><p>a driver&#39;s license.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The verification process is done by e-mail. You will receive one form hello[at]mastodon.vlaanderen and a DM from one of the admin&#39;s that you should have received an e-mail from us. The e-mails will be permanently deleted for safety reasons when the verification process is complete.</p>

<p>Just like for (commercial) entities, we recommend you to host your own instance so that people can instantly verify that you are really the one that you claim to be. Which is not always guaranteed  on a random instance.  </p>

<h3>Usage by bots</h3>

<p>Bots are allowed on this instance under circumstances:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Excessive posting with public visibility are forbidden. This may annoy other users who want to discover stuff in the local timeline</p></li>
<li><p>The maintainer of the bot must be displayed in the bot&#39;s bio</p></li>
<li><p>When using data from 3rd party sources. Make sure you have permission to use it. </p></li>
<li><p>Follow the rules defined by this instance as well as abide by the ToS and CoC</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Termination of the service</h3>

<p>The admins of mastodon.vlaanderen have the right to suspend any account if they believe that the suspended account was not following the rules defined by this server. Or did not abide by the terms of service. The suspended account have 30 days to download their data to be used to move to another instance if they wish. Some data may be retained so that the user cannot evade suspension. The user has the right to appeal their suspension once. Like we stated above, the admins have the right about the final fate of the suspended account without any discussion. </p>

<p>The account can also be (temporary) freezed and/or we can block the access to our services if we believe the user was doing stuff that degrades the performance of the service and/or was involved in illegal activities.</p>

<h3>Quality of the service</h3>

<p>Like we said earlier we try to give the users the best experience Mastodon (and the Fediverse in general) can have. The servers are monitored and back-upped regularly. But as with any service, some downtime can occur. When that happens we will try our best to do get it back up online within a &quot;reasonable&quot; time. </p>

<p>Since this Mastodon instance is run by individuals and not as a commercial service with SLA&#39;s and similar stuff. Don&#39;t expect from us that we fix stuff in the middle of the night or during business hours with a tight deadline. Because we all have a paid job and other obligations besides running and maintaining this instance.</p>

<p>You can check our <a href=""https://status.mastodon.vlaanderen/status/mastodon-vlaanderen"">status page</a> for that. Keep it as an bookmark in your browser as we will put our updates on that platform as well. </p>

<h3>Cross-posting from other sources (such as Twitter)</h3>

<p>Cross-posting is copying of posts from one platform to another via automatic ways. It is allowed but under the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
<li>The account being cross-posted is owned by the same person or entity. Third-party copying is not permitted</li>
<li>The (Mastodon) account is at least partially monitored by the author, so that interactions from Mastodon users are not ignored.</li>
</ul>

<h2>(very) Brief server infrastructure information</h2>

<ul>
<li>The servers that runs the Mastodon software as well as the underlying database &amp; media are sponsored &amp; hosted in Belgium by Barnes &amp; Morgan BV.</li>
<li>Our e-mails are managed and stored by a Belgian mail provider <a href=""https://mailfence.com/"">MailFence</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The servers are backed-up at least on a daily basis. </p>

<h2>Reporting and moderation</h2>

<p> When reporting accounts, please make sure to include at least a few posts that show rule-breaking behavior, when applicable, or what content is offensive. If there is any additional context that might help make a decision, please also include it in the comment.</p>

<p> I usually handle reports within 24 hours, but this may vary depending on how busy I am. Please remember that you are not notified when a report you have made has led to a punitive action, and that not all punitive actions are externally visible. </p>

If you are part of the LGBTQIA community you are very cordially invited to join this server.",LGBTQIA.Space,
285,636814c680bb3f03b435a2d7,zirk.us,False,5659,"<p>Please read the server rules and the information below before signing up to and/or using Zirkus. If you don’t agree to all of the terms set out here, please do not use this server. By continuing to use Zirkus, you agree to be bound by the terms set out here.<br></p>

<p><br><em>Guidelines</em><br>
<ul>
<li><u>Language:</u> There are no language rules on this server. English is <em>de facto</em> the main language, but feel free (even encouraged!) to post in other languages.</li>
<li><u>Content warnings:</u> We do not require a content warning (CW) for posts about politics, social justice, etc. However, we ask that you be kind and considerate: include CWs if you believe your post may be distressing.</li>
<li><u>Bots:</u> Bots are allowed. Try to make them fun.</li>
<li><u>Cross-posting:</u> Cross-posting from Twitter, RSS, etc. is fine (and even encouraged if it helps you become more active here).</li>
<li><u>Topics:</u> You do not need to remain permanently &quot;on topic&quot;. The point of this arts/humanities community is to gather like-minded people who will make posts that are interesting to each other. But that doesn&#39;t mean that everything has to be about books, art, etc. This is a community to connect people, not enforce specific topics of discussion.</li>
<li><u>Self-promotion:</u> There are many writers and artists on this server, and we are more than happy for you to promote your work from your personal account. We request, however, that you do so in a tasteful and not spammy manner.</li>
<li><u>Industry promotion:</u> If you are a commercial entity of interest to our community (literary magazine, publishing house, etc.), we are also happy for you to promote here in a tasteful manner. However, we request that you make a modest donation, as this is a volunteer-run server that relies on crowdfunding (see below). Please contact the admins if you have any questions.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><br><em>Donations</em><br>
<ul>
<li>You can donate to Zirkus on Patreon <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/zirkus"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</li>
<li>We are run entirely by volunteers on a non-profit basis and are dependent on donations to cover our hosting costs.</li>
<li>We&#39;re currently hosted on <a href=""https://masto.host"" target=""_blank"">masto.host</a> and are looking to raise <em>$420/month</em> to support 5,500 users comfortably. We will publish new goals as necessary based on our user numbers.</li>
<li>We ultimately hope to crowdfund via <a href=""https://opencollective.com"" target=""_blank"">Open Collective</a>, which offers greater transparency over expenses and more flexibility for contributors. Our Patreon page is a temporary solution while we await approval from a fiscal host on Open Collective. Once we have migrated crowdfunding to Open Collective, all funds raised on Patreon will be transferred to that account, the Patreon page will be shut down and contributors will be informed of the move.</li>
<li>Every little helps a lot. We’d like to thank our community for all their support so far!</li>
</ul></p>

<p><br><em>Moderation and reporting posts</em><br>
<ul>
<li>When you report an account or server, please indicate which server rule has been broken and include any extra context or explanation, if possible.</li>
<li>We are volunteer moderators and will try to address the issue as soon as we are able.</li>
<li>You will not be notified about the result, even if it has led to punitive action, which may not be visible to the outside. The response will be proportional to the nature of the offence.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><br><em>Post visibility and privacy</em><br>
<ul>
<li>Please bear in mind that your posts – depending on their visibility – are public. We recommend not sharing information publicly that you do not intend to share with the whole internet.</li>
<li>When you post, bear in mind that posts cannot be hidden by locking an account. Posts can be deleted either manually or set to auto-delete within various timeframes. Please familiarize yourself with the different visibility options for posting: Public, Unlisted, Followers Only, and Mentioned People Only (i.e. a direct message).</li>
<li>The displaying and distribution of your post happens strictly according to the visibility rules you have set for the post. We will not modify the visibility of the post you have set.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><br><em>Your data and privacy</em><br>
<ul>
<li>We can see basic account and profile information that you provide when signing up to the server, such as username, email, name (real or fake) and IP address.</li>
<li>We do not share your information with any third parties.</li>
<li>The server administrators can technically access users’ direct messages, but pledge not to do so. This option is also not available in the default admin UI. We strongly recommend not sending any confidential or private information via direct message on Mastodon (or equally on Twitter) because the messages are not end-to-end encrypted. WhatsApp and Signal are currently end-to-end encrypted applications.</li>
<li>We do not log information about your use of this server or run any form of analytics. Our hosting provider, <a href=""https://masto.host"" target=""_blank"">masto.host</a>, keeps a log of the IP addresses of the requests made to the server, which is auto-deleted in less than 90 days.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><br><em>Liability</em><br>
<ul>
<li>You are responsible for the content that you make available to the server, including its legality and appropriateness. Please abide by the above server rules when using Zirkus. In case of breach of rules, the administrators reserve the right to remove you.</li>
<li>In no event will Zirkus, the administrators and the moderators be liable to you or any third party for any special, indirect, incidental, exemplary or consequential damages of any kind arising out of or in connection with the server and content included on or otherwise made available to you through the server.</li>

    Cross-posting
</h2>
<p>
    ""Cross-posting"" is the automatic copying of posts from one platform to
    another. That definition does <strong>not</strong> include the simultaneous
    posting to multiple platforms from the same app, such as Twidere or
    PostyBirb. If you use those apps, we consider those posts original, and the
    following need not apply.
</p>

<p>
    Cross-posting from Mastodon to other platforms is fully permitted.
    <strong>
        Cross-posting into Mastodon from another platform is permitted under
        the following terms:
    </strong>
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        The posts do not include platform-specific references, e.g. talking
        about ""here"" meaning Twitter, or including text from other non-Mastodon
        users verbatim (e.g. cross-posted quote tweets)
    </li>
    <li>
        The account is at least semi-regularly monitored by the author, so that
        interactions from Mastodon users are not ignored
    </li>
    <li>
        The account being cross-posted is owned by the same person. Third-party
        copying of content is not permitted
    </li>

<p>The best way to get in touch for questions and issues concerning the server is through <a href=""mailto:support@ohai.social"">support@ohai.social</a>.</p>

<h1>Security &amp; Backups</h1>

<p>This Mastodon server is hosted on bare metal in a data center in the south of Germany. Two people have access to the infrastructure, and all SSH access is exclusively using hardware security tokens. We will never sell or otherwise use your data for anything other than the operation of this Mastodon server, and we certainly do not read your DMs.</p>

<p>All database data is backed up twice daily in a physically different location from the live data (Specifically, at <a href=""https://www.borgbase.com/"">BorgBase</a>).</p>

<p>In the unlikely event that we will ever have to shut down the server, we intend to give at least 6+ months of notice ahead of the shutdown.</p>

<h1>Best practices</h1>

<p>The list below is a collection of behavior that we expect to see from our users. If you see a user go against these best practices in a way that bothers you, please file a report and we will talk to them. While these best practices are designed to be guidelines for a good communal instance, repeated malicious unwillingness to follow the best practices will be considered just like breaking a rule.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In general, use the tools provided to foster a considerate and accessible atmosphere. This includes the liberal use of content warnings (especially on potentially disturbing or controversial topics), and alt-text captioning of media files.</p></li>
<li><p>When possible, provide credit for creative works in your posts that are not your own.</p></li>
<li><p>Uninvited comments about another user&#39;s personal choices, lifestyle or family are strongly discouraged and may be considered harassment. Inappropriate sexual attention, comments about appearance and implication of physical contact will not be tolerated toward any non-consenting user.</p></li>
<li><p>If you post sexual content or gore, use content warnings.</p></li>
<li><p>If you post advertisements, use a content warning. Advertisements should not be excessive or automated.</p></li>
<li><p>Bots may only interact with a user when they&#39;re invited by that user to do so.</p></li>
<li><p>Automated posts and high-frequency posts should be unlisted (rendering visible to everybody, but not appearing on the local timeline) to keep the local timeline of our instance a place of community dialogue and human interaction. This extends to bots, feed posters, Twitter &quot;retweets&quot; and Twitter crossposts with broken mentions (&quot;…@twitter.com&quot;). Crossposter accounts that stop being active participants in our community may be removed at the discretion of the moderators.</p></li>
<li><p>In discussions, please remain civil, do not insult the people you&#39;re talking to. Note that irony, sarcasm, or similar modes of language don&#39;t translate well to written language and tend to escalate discussions or misunderstandings.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id=""welcome-to-seo-chat"">Welcome to SEO.chat</h3>
<p>
An open source, social network based on Mastodon, and focused on SEO. Managed by <a href=""https://seo.chat/@fili"">@fili@seo.chat</a>. 
</p>
<p>
This Mastodon server was created and set up for the SEO community to have a place to come together, share knowledge and test things out. Its primary service is to provide a platform for the Search Engine Optimization community.
</p>
<p>
The primary instance language is English.
</p>
<p>
Best efforts are made to keep the server up and running, but sometimes things may be outside the admin's control, such as the managed hosting provider experiencing downtime, or <a href=""https://mastodon.social/@dannysullivan/109326516085850657"">Google inadvertently mistaking the server for phishing</a>. 
</p>

<h3 id=""code-of-conduct"">Code of Conduct</h3>
<p>
SEO.chat aims to be a nice community of marketers, sharing and helping each other. You are welcome to join!
</p>
<p>
Basic rules:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Be polite and kind. Don't be a jerk. Religious speech, hate speech, discrimination, and harassment of any kind is not tolerated on this server.</li>
<li>Be respectful - even if you disagree.</li>
<li>No spam or commercial advertisements.</li>
<li>This server is intended for anyone who works in the field of Search Engine Optimization.</li>
<li>The primary language for this server is English. Although it is fine to discuss SEO examples/cases/details related to different markets, languages and locales, make sure that the primary language of your posts are in English.</li>
</ul>
<p>
And everything will be fine.
</p>

<h3 id=""application"">When applying to join</h3>
<p>
When you sign up to join, you will be asked to provide an answer to <em>""Why do you want to join?""</em>. Take a moment to write down your response. If your response is unrelated to SEO and is lacking the requested information, your application to join will likely be rejected.
</p>
<p>
This server is committed to the <a href=""https://joinmastodon.org/covenant"">Mastodon Server Covenant</a> and is hosted in Germany.
</p>

<h3 id=""best-practices"">Best practices</h3>
<p>
The list below is a collection of behavior expected from SEO.chat users. If you see a user go against these best practices in a way that bothers you, please file a report and the moderators will talk to them. While these best practices are designed to be guidelines for a good communal instance, <strong>repeated malicious unwillingness</strong> to follow the best practices will be considered just like breaking a rule.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>In general, use the tools provided to foster a considerate and accessible atmosphere. This includes the liberal use of content warnings (especially on potentially disturbing or controversial topics), and alt-text captioning of media files.</li>
  <li>When possible, provide credit for creative works in your posts that are not your own.</li>
  <li>Uninvited comments about another user's personal choices, lifestyle or family are strongly discouraged and may be considered harassment. Inappropriate sexual attention, comments about appearance and implication of physical contact will not be tolerated toward any non-consenting user.</li>
  <li>If you post potentially graphical content or gore, use content warnings.</li>
  <li>If you post any advertisements, use a content warning. Advertisements should not be excessive or automated.</li>
  <li>Bots may only interact with a user when they're invited by that user to do so.</li>
  <li>Automated posts and high-frequency posts should be <strong>unlisted</strong> (rendering visible to everybody, but not appearing on the local timeline) to keep the local timeline of SEO.chat instance a place of community dialogue and human interaction. This extends to bots, feed posters, Twitter ""retweets"" and Twitter crossposts with broken mentions (""…@twitter.com""). Crossposter accounts that stop being active participants in SEO.chat community may be removed at the discretion of the moderators.</li>
  <li>In discussions, please remain civil, do not insult the people you're talking to. Note that irony, sarcasm, or similar modes of language don't translate well to written language and tend to escalate discussions or misunderstandings.</li>
<li>Do not debate moderation actions in public posts. If you disagree with how a moderator enforced the rules you may direct-message the moderation team.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>(These best practices were inspired by the Terms of bsd.network and chaos.social. Thank you!)</em>
</p>

<h3 id=""content-not-allowed"">Content not allowed</h3>
<p>
The following rules are a (non-exhaustive) list of behaviors and type of content that may lead to deletion of toots, silencing or suspension of accounts, at the discretion of the instance administrators, as described in the SEO.chat <a href=""/terms"">Terms</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Any illegal content (doxing, leaking private information, under age content, etc)</li>
<li>Adult (pornography) content</li>
<li>Spam</li>
<li>Commercial advertisements</li>
<li>Racism</li>
<li>Political content</li>
<li>Alt right, including under the disguise of freedom of speech</li>
<li>Gore and extremely graphic violence, including artistic depictions</li>
<li>National Socialism</li>
<li>Nazism</li>
<li>Holocaust denial</li>
<li>Gender-critical</li>
<li>Sex and gender discrimination</li>
<li>Transphobia</li>
<li>Misogyny</li>
<li>Trolling, insulting and derogatory comments towards others using a seo.chat account</li>
<li>Spreading falsehoods, alternative facts, anecdotal evidence, prejudice or bias towards a social group, inciting violence, circular reporting, shock-provoking content, conspiracy theories, dark patterns, deepfakes, disinformation, misinformation, sensationalism, truthiness, propaganda, rumors, hoaxes, urban myths, pseudoscience, post-truth and opinion pieces or interviews that convey any of the previous.</li>
<li>Threats of Physical violence against any person, animal or institution.</li>
<li>Posts in other languages than English</li>
</ul>
<p>
The admin (<a href=""https://seo.chat/@fili"">@fili</a>) is maintaining this SEO.chat instance in his spare time, finances, hardware and nerves. Please don't push any of those.
</p>

<h3 id=""report"">Reporting Violations</h3>
<p>
Please report behavior that bothers you. The moderators will keep your report confidential.
Accounts found to be breaking the rules will be banned without a warning.
</p>

<p>
If you notice a post that violates the rules, please report it. It is easy to assume that someone else has already reported a post, but it is easy for everyone to feel that way and no one to report the post. If you feel personally uncomfortable with the kind of attention you’re receiving, please reach out to the moderation team.
</p>

<p>
The moderation team will always take a pragmatic approach to every report they receive - if a problematic post isn’t explicitly called out above, yet is inappropriate for SEO.chat (not related to SEO), the post will likely be removed, and the member will be dealt with appropriately.

<p>The current priority is to make this place a welcome home for its users. This means, in order of priority, we will be pursuing 1) Reliability and uptime (within budget), 2) Accessibility and 3) Usability (make this a place people want to join, with relevant content).</p>

<li><p><strong>Q:</strong> I&#39;ve seen rule breaking content on this instance. How do I report it?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A:</strong> Use that report button! But <em>please</em> only use it for content that breaks our rules. If you think the rules need to be changed, contact us at the email above.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Q:</strong> What happens if this instance gets shut down?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A:</strong> The intent is to transfer the server to a new owner if shutting down is ever an option. Per the <a href=""https://joinmastodon.org/covenant"">Mastodon server covenant</a>, three months notice will be given prior to any move or shutdown events.</p></li>

<p>The data you post here lives on a server that Keith Calder runs. He promises that he won’t look at your private data. You are just going to have to trust him on this.</p>

<p>This is, however, an ActivityPub federated server. This means that other people on other federated servers can find you, send you messages, etc. This also means that any information you put in posts, whether they are public or private, might end up “federated” — basically, a copy of your post gets put on any server that reads your post.</p>

<p>If you want decent privacy (the info doesn’t leave this server), the only way to do that is to set your account to private, only accept friend requests from other bbq.snoot.com users, and only ever @ mention other bbq.snoot.com users. Once you start talking to people on other servers, all bets are off. <em>Any private message you send to someone on another server could be looked at by the admin of a different server.</em> This is kind of like email: if you are on a private email server, and you send an unencrypted email to a gmail account, congrats, Google now has the content of that email. But also, you do this every day, so, hey. The internet!</p>

<p>This is <strong>wetdry.world</strong>, a community website running on a custom branch of <a href=""https://joinmastodon.org"">Mastodon</a> (we call it <a href=""https://github.com/TheEssem/mastodon"">Chuckya</a>!) focused on gaming, tech, humor, and generally whatever you may be interested in. 
We are connected to the wider &quot;fedisphere&quot;, a large network of thousands of interconnected social websites, which means that a single account here on wetdry.world lets you interact and chat with millions of people from across the entire web!</p>

<p>We host some other stuff here as well:

<p><em>Wet-Dry World, also known as Wet-Dry Land, is the eleventh course in Super Mario 64 and Super Mario 64 DS, and it takes place within flooded ruins, separated into an undeveloped uptown that the player starts in and an underground downtown further into the level. The entrance to the course is the large painting with the Skeeter on it on the Mushroom Castle&#39;s second floor. Unique to this course is the ability to raise or lower the water level based on where the painting is entered; the lower the painting is entered, the lower the water level, and the higher the painting is entered, the higher the water level.</em>

<h2>The Long Version</h2>

<h3>I. User Accounts</h3>

<p>The Union Place is open to all union members, organizations, friends, and allies. Content posted on The Union Place need not be entirely, or even majority, union or labor-movement related.</p>

<p>Given the broad consensus among many marginalized and progressive communities that <a href=""https://theconversation.com/why-police-unions-are-not-part-of-the-american-labor-movement-142538"">police unions are not a true part of the labor movement</a>, police unions are not welcome on The Union Place. We will not specifically screen to prevent members of police unions from joining, but content pushing a pro-police and pro-police union agenda will be considered unacceptable.

wenden Sie Sich zur Klärung von Nutzungsrechten an Beiträgen direkt an die/den

<h2 id=""guidelines"">Grundsätze und Leitlinien</h2>

<p>Diese Mastodon-Instanz soll Mitgliedern und Gliederungen von BÜNDNIS 90/DIE 
GRÜNEN, der GRÜNEN Jugend, sowie von Netzbegrünung e. V. die Möglichkeit geben,
an dezentralen sozialen Netzwerken teilzuhaben. Der Betrieb einer eigenen Instanz
im Umfeld der GRÜNEN soll dabei helfen, Individuen und Gliederungen wie Orts-
und Kreisverbände untereinander zu vernetzen und innerhalb des Mastodon- und
ActivityPub-Netzwerks (""Fediverse"") eigenständige Community zu schaffen.</p>

<p>Das Angebot befindet sich derzeit in der Erprobungsphase. Wir sammeln
Erfahrungen in Bezug auf die administrativen Aufwände, sowohl technischer als
auch nicht-technischer Natur.</p>

<p>Aktuell tragen wir als Netzbegrünung e. V. die Kosten des Betriebs. Für
Nutzerinnen und Nutzer ist das Angebot im Moment kostenlos.</p>

<p>Wir können keine Gewährleistung für die Verfügbarkeit dieses Angebots
bieten.</p>

<p>Zum aktuellen Zeitpunkt können wir noch nicht abschätzen, ob dieses Angebot
langfristig bestehen bleiben wird. Falls wir eine Entscheidung treffen sollten,
den Betrieb einzustellen, werden wir alle Nutzer*innen informieren und die
Plattform noch mindestens einen Monat lang weiter in Betrieb halten. Damit
sollte allen Nutzer*innen die Möglichkeit gegeben sein, ihre Daten zu exportieren
und ggf. einen Umzug auf eine andere Instanz zu organisieren.</p>

<p>Diese Mastodon-Instanz versteht sich als Angebot von Menschen für Menschen. Wir
bitten daher darum, hier von Experimenten mit bots und automatisierten Postings
abzusehen. Dafür eignen sich Instanzen wie beispielsweise
<a href=""https://botsin.space/"">botsin.space</a>.</p>

<p>Wir behalten uns vor, den Austausch mit Instanzen zu beschränken bzw. zu
blockieren, die aus einem Grund oder mehreren Gründen nicht mit unseren Werten
und Überzeugungen im Einklang stehen. Beispiele für mögliche Gründe:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Verbreitung von rechtsradikalen oder menschenverachtenden Botschaften</li>
  <li>Verbreitung von Bildern und Filmen, auf denen sexuelle Gewalt an Kindern zu sehen ist</li>
  <li>Verbreitung von Holocaust-Leugnungen</li>
</ul>

<p>Eine Liste der geblockten Instanzen veröffentlichen wir am Ende dieser
  Seite.</p>

<p>Änderungen an diesen Leitlinien oder dem Verhaltenskodex werden sowohl per
Mastdon (von <em>TODO</em>) als auch per E-Mail und ggf. unter
<a href=""https://blog.netzbegruenung.de/"">blog.netzbegruenung.de</a> bekannt
gegeben.</p>

<h2 id=""vertraulichkeit"">Vertraulichkeit und Sicherheit von Direktnachrichten</h2>

<p>Mastodon und kompatible Plattformen bieten die Möglichkeit, nicht-öffentliche
Direktnachrichten mit anderen Nutzer*innen auszutauschen. Bitte versteht diese
Funktion nicht als Ersatz für sichere Nachrichten-Plattformen mit
Ende-zu-Ende-Verschlüsselung. Zieht die nachfolgenden Informationen in Betracht,
wenn Ihr entscheidet, für welche Art von Kommunikation Ihr diese Funktion nutzen
möchtet.</p>

<p>Für uns als Betreiber, die Netzbegrünung e. V., besteht technisch die
Möglichkeit, Einblick in alle Nachrichten zu nehmen, die Nutzer*innen auf
dieser Instanz erhalten oder senden. Das gilt auch für Direktnachrichten. Es
ist jedoch Teil unseres Selbstverständnis als Betreiber von
Kommunikationsinfrastruktur, dass wir niemals von dieser Möglichkeit Gebrauch
machen werden. Gleichzeitig ist es nicht ausgeschlossen, dass wir
beispielsweise in Fehlermeldungen oder Logs auch mit Inhalten von
Direktnachrichten konfrontiert werden, ohne dies zu beabsichtigen.</p>

<p>Die gleichen technische Möglichkeiten, die wir auf gruene.social haben, haben
auch die Admins anderer Instanzen, mit denen Ihr Nachrichten austauscht.</p>

<h2 id=""codeofconduct"">Verhaltenskodex (Code of Conduct)</h2>

<p>Als Nutzer*in von gruene.social erkenne ich den folgenden Verhaltenskodex an
und erkläre, mich dem entsprechend zu verhalten.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ich achte die Würde meiner Mitmenschen und Mitnutzer*innen.</li>
  <li>Ich beachte die geltenden Gesetze, insbesondere das Urheberrecht, das
    Persönlichkeitsrecht und den Datenschutz.</li>
  <li>Sollte ich Inhalte, insbesondere Ton, Video und Bild, veröffentlichen,
    die andere verstören könnten, beispielsweise durch Darstellung von Gewalt,
    verwende ich die Funktion ""als heikle Medien markieren"".</li>
  <li>Sollte ich eine Verletzung der Regeln dieses Kodex bemerken, nehme ich das
    nicht stillschweigend hin, sondern informiere ich die Moderator*innen

310,636efa5780bb3f03b435a4eb,mas.town,False,2114,"<p>Overview </p>

<p>mas.town is a new social media alternative focused on robust and responsible public dialogue, NOT controlled by big tech (or associated algorithms). mas.town runs on the Mastodon decentralized network - taking control away from big tech providers - and placing it into individual communities. mas.town is fully federated - meaning you can connect, follow, and interact with anyone on any other server.</p>

<p>As an instance, we fully subscribe to the Mastodon Covenant. </p>

<p>Data Security | Data Privacy</p>

<p>Choosing an instance/server is one of the more important decisions you will make. It’s less about the topic of interest - since you can connect with anybody - and more about how safe and secure your data is, and how well moderated the server is. To that end, all information on mas.town is hosted in the USA, housed on AWS, and backed up daily for data security and privacy. Additionally - we actively moderate posts, users, and instances who violate community norms. </p>

<p>Grassroots Engagement</p>

<p>The Mastodon network is different than what most are accustomed to. Because there are no algorithms to feed you what the provider wants you to see (or what the provider thinks you want to see) - you are in control of your feed. The more you engage and interact, the more you see content germane to your interests! There’s a bit of a growing period up front to establish your network, and a learning curve for the environment, but it is well worth it in the end! </p>

<p>How You Might Help</p>

<p>The mastodon network is run by volunteers, who pay for the servers and give of their time. If you enjoy the mas.town instance and want to offset our costs, you are welcome to contribute (once, or on a recurring basis) to:</p>

<p>Patreon: https://patreon.com/user?u=82983268</p>

<p>We actively ""defederate"" masto.nu from other instances that are incompatible with our fundamental rules, in an effort to protect our users. This comes from reports of users but also community discussion around such bad actors.

This includes things like active moderation, daily backups, multiple staff members, and a commitment to provide notice to changes in the status of this instance.</p>

<h3 id=""following-norms"">Following Norms</h3>

<p>There are certain ""norms"" of Mastodon, and the wider ""Fediverse"" that you'll be expected to follow while a member of this instance. This includes the use of content warnings when necessary, and the regular use of descriptive text for image uploads. Some of these norms may be different than what you're used to on other platforms. While failure to use these these are not strictly moderation worth events, we do ask that you respect and try and conform to these norms as you explore and grow on the platform.</p>

<h3 id=""our-discretion"">Our Discretion</h3>

<p>We want to foster an open discussion where <b>everyone</b> feels welcome. The rules are meant to be clear and direct, but the staff of this instance has ultimate discretion on how they are enforced. We may alter to these rules as needed, but will make an effort to notify you of any major change.</p>

<p>If you are found to be in violation, the staff may take any action they deem appropriate, such as a warning or an expulsion from the server.</p>

<h2 id=""your-account"">Your Account</h2>

<p>You may your close account or move it to another instance at any time. You are in control of your identity and your social graph on Mastodon (and other federated instances) but the administrators here control your ability to use this instance and ultimately to interact with its users.</p>

<p>In addition to regular backups we make of our infrastructure, you can backup your data and export it at any time. You can also delete your account and your data at anytime. You can even schedule regular deletions of previous posts, if that's your thing.</p>

<h3 id=""data-security"">Data Security</h3>

<p>Unless it's required of us to investigate a reported instance of abuse of our policies, under standard operation we have no ability to regularly access your direct messages with other members of our platform. While this data is accessible with a request to our hosting providers database systems, we expect that to not be necessary except under extreme circumstances. Where possible we will notify you if such processes are taken for data associated by your account.</p>

<p>However, due in part to the open and federated nature of Mastodon instances, the Mastodon administrators of other instances you interact with may have access to your data.</p>

<p>While the connection to this site is encrypted, this is only the data in transit to you and to other servers in the federated network. <strong>The messages and data stored in the instance is not encrypted.</strong> This includes direct messages sent to other users of masto.nu! This is not a choice of the administrator, but a limitation of the Mastodon platform. Additionally, our hosting provider may have access to your data as part of the general administration of the server infrastructure.</p> 

<p>You should use Signal, Matrix, or another E2E messaging app for the things you really want to be private.</p>

<h2 id=""trending-features"">Trending Features</h2>

<p>One of the key features of Mastodon is there's no sophisticated algorithm to drive more traffic to the site, or influence your thinking. Mastodon does offer hashtag, post, and link trending features that are based solely on observed activity within masto.nu and other federated instances.</p>

<p>Hashtags largely trend on their own without moderator intervention, but can be removed if they are abusive or disruptive. Some links will trend automatically if they're from mainstream or other sources known to be reputable. Some posts will trend automatically if they're from known figures with a history of appropriate content. Other trends are manually approved by our staff, and only removed if they are deemed inappropriate.</p>

<p>For security and safety reasons, we do not presently publish our instance-wide moderation policies to the public, but instance users may view the policy by logging in.</p>

<p>Utmost care is taken to prevent metadata leakage to other instances, including the use of authenticated object fetch requirements.  Administrators of other instances are encouraged to send any concerns or questions to the admin team concerning our instance-wide moderation policies, including to request a list in Mastodon&#39;s standard CSV format of current moderation policies.</p>

<p><strong>Moderation policy (Code of Conduct)</strong></p>

<p>User behavior and content are required to comply with US federal laws and the Revised Code of Washington.  Content and behavior which is not in compliance is expressly forbidden and may result in account termination and, in some cases, reporting to authorities as required for our own compliance.</p>

<p>User behavior and content is also expected to abide by the server rules, outlined below:</p>

<p><em>Organization and project accounts are by invitation only.</em></p>

<p>Accounts belonging to organizations and project accounts are by invitation of the moderation team.  These accounts are expected to uphold the values of this community to a greater extent than normal accounts.</p>

<p>For a multitude of reasons, corporate accounts are not welcome on Treehouse.  We recommend running dedicated instances for corporations.</p>

<p><em>Identity verification requirement to use this server.</em></p>

<p>In order to sign up for an account, your identity must either be verified by the moderation staff, or you must be explicitly invited to use the instance by a current member.</p>

<p>To streamline the identity verification process, please provide links to other examples of your presence online.  This will allow our team to determine if you would be a good fit for our community.</p>

<p><em>Be kind to each other.</em></p>

<p>To foster a healthy community, we expect interactions to be kind and empathetic.  If you find yourself getting annoyed or frustrated with a conversation, we encourage you to step away for a moment and regroup your thoughts.</p>

<p><em>No violence.</em></p>

<p>Content which describes explicit violence towards others is explicitly forbidden.  Ranting and similar content is allowed but it may be beneficial to the community at large and its moderation staff to use a content warning to clarify the intention behind the content.</p>

<p><em>No fascism, white supremacy, etc.</em></p>

<p>Content relating to fascism, neo-fascism, Trumpism, white supremacy, male supremacy, alt-right ideology, and so on, is explicitly forbidden.  Accounts trafficking in this content will be banned with no possibility of appeal.</p>

<p><em>No colonialism or nationalism.</em></p>

<p>Content relating to nationalist or colonialist ideology is explicitly forbidden.  Accounts trafficking in this content will be banned with no possibility of appeal.</p>

<p><em>No racism, homophobia, transphobia, etc.</em></p>

<p>This instance is intended to be a safe space for LGBTQIA+ and PoC people.  Accounts which are not compliant with this policy will be banned with no possibility of appeal.</p>

<p><em>No religious extremism.</em></p>

<p>Content relating to the promotion of religious extremist ideology is not allowed, for the same reasons that all of the other content types above are not allowed.  Accounts trafficking in this content will be banned with no possibility of appeal.</p>

<p><em>Use content warnings for explicit content.</em></p>

<p>Explicit content such as, but not limited to, adult content, content including extreme gore, depictions of violence, and any content which may trigger panic responses in individuals with common phobias (such as arachnophobia) must be marked sensitive and content warned.</p>

<p>If moderators have to fix your posts to comply with this policy, you will be given a warning.  After multiple warnings, your account may be suspended or terminated at the discretion of the moderation staff.</p>

<p><em>Reporting violations of this Code of Conduct.</em></p>

<p>Users may report content which they believe to be either illegal or a violation of server rules in the Mastodon web interface.</p>

People who have been blocked over on Twitter either individually or as part of a block chain, are welcome here. The admins and moderators <em>will not</em> be personally blocking anyone on disabled.social unless there are threats of violence or overt defamatory claims made (which is a rules violation, and your account will be handled accordingly). There are several of us running this instance, so if there is an issue you need to raise, hopefully there is someone here that you are comfortable speaking with. </p>

<p>ALL are welcome here.</p>

<h2>Sign Ups</h2>

<p>When signing up, please indicate both why you want to join disabled.social and more importantly, how you plan to use the instance. </p>

<p>We have many organizations, charities, non-profits, adaptive tech developers, attorneys, medical providers with businesses, etc. interested in joining the instance, and we want to understand how you plan on using our space which is intended as a support space for disabled people.</p>

<p>We do not allow marketing to disabled people or mining them for your own commercial gains under any circumstances.</p>

<p>Failure to answer how you plan to use the instance will result in rejection of your application.</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>

<p> ""Be excellent to each other"" is easier said than done, and means different things to different people. </p>

<p>The following rules are a (non-exhaustive) list of behaviors that may lead to deletion of toots, silencing or suspension of accounts, at the discretion of the instance administrators, as described in our Terms.</p>

<p>Please report offensive behavior to the contact email address provided. Reports will be kept confidential.</p>

<ul>
<li>We do not tolerate discriminatory behaviour or content promoting/advocating the oppression of members of marginalised groups. These groups may be characterized by any of the following (though this list is naturally incomplete): Ethnicity or race; Gender identity or expression; Sexual identity or expression; Physical characteristics or age; Disability or illness; Nationality, residency, citizen status; Wealth or education; Religious affiliation, agnosticism, or atheism; Neurodivergence</li>

<li>We do not tolerate threatening behavior, stalking, or doxxing.</li>
<li>We do not tolerate harassment, including brigading, dogpiling, or any other form of contact with a user who has stated that they do not wish to be contacted.</li>

<li>We do not tolerate violent nationalist propaganda, Nazi symbolism, or promoting the ideology of National Socialism.</li>
<li>We do not tolerate conspiracy narratives or other reactionary myths supporting or leading to the above-mentioned (and/or similar) behavior.</li>
<li>Scientific discussion is critical to our community. However, conspiracy theories related to anti-vaxx and COVID19 without any scientific basis will not be tolerated.</li>
</ul>

<p>Actions intended to damage this instance or its performance may lead to immediate temporary or permanent account suspension.</p>

<p>Content that is illegal in the United States will be deleted and may lead to immediate account suspension.</p>

<h2>General Best Practices</h2>

<p>The list below is a collection of behaviors that we expect to see from our users. If you see a user go against these best practices in a way that bothers you, please file a report and we will talk to them. While these best practices are designed to be guidelines for a good communal instance, repeated malicious unwillingness to follow the best practices will be considered just like breaking a rule.</p>

<ul>
<li>In general, use the tools provided to foster a considerate and accessible atmosphere. This includes the liberal use of content warnings (especially on potentially disturbing or controversial topics), and alt-text captioning of media files.</li>
<li>When possible, provide credit for creative works in your posts that are not your own.</li>
<li>Uninvited comments about another user's personal choices, lifestyle or family are strongly discouraged and may be considered harassment. Inappropriate sexual attention, comments about appearance and implication of physical contact will not be tolerated toward any non-consenting user.</li>
<li>If you post sexual content or gore, use content warnings.</li>
<li>If you post advertisements, use a content warning. Advertisements should not be excessive or automated.</li>
<li>Bots may only interact with a user when they're invited by that user to do so.</li>
<li>Automated posts and high-frequency posts should be unlisted (rendering visible to everybody, but not appearing on the local timeline) to keep the local timeline of our instance a place of community dialogue and human interaction. This extends to bots, feed posters, Twitter ""retweets"" and Twitter crossposts with broken mentions (""…@twitter.com""). Crossposter accounts that stop being active participants in our community may be removed at the discretion of the moderators.</li>
<li>In discussions, please remain civil, do not insult the people you're talking to. When using sarcasm, please indicate with /s.</li>
<li>Please be mindful of your language, and avoid the use of ableist and saneist language. We recognize that sometimes it can be hard to find another word to clearly communicate what you are trying to say. We have created a resource to help you find alternative language while still being able to convey your point.</li>
<li>Please use captions in uploaded videos.</li>
<li>There are times when users just want to vent about their situation. Unless requested explicitly, please do not drop unsolicited advice. In some cases, it might be ok to ask OP directly if they want advice.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Best Practices to Assist Screen Readers</h2>

<p>Some of our users make use of screen readers. There are a few things that make for a smoother experience:
<ul>
    <li>Reminder to alt-text your images. If you are low on spoons, please use #AltTextHelp and someone from the community should be able to help and provide it.</li>
    <li>Avoid using multiple emojis in a row. Ex: putting 3 smiley faces in a row, or 60 red flags.</li>
    <li>If you want to use hashtags throughout a toot, please do so sparingly. Best to put the majority of them at the end of the toot.</li>
    <li>Use CamelCase for the hashtags. Ex: #DisabledSocial</li>
    <li>Please use as few emoji in usernames or screen names as possible (preferably none)</li>
    <li>Please don&#39;t scatter emojis between words in an alternating pattern. Ex: word followed by clapping hands emoji, repeated indefinitely. Use them sparingly.</li>
    <li>When sharing a link, please provide a brief description of where the link directs to.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>(These best practices were inspired by the Terms of chaos.social. Thank you!)</p>

<h2>Mutual Aid</h2>

<p>The posting and sharing of mutual aid and fundraisers are welcome here on disabled.social because they are critical for the survival of some of our members. Disability payments are often woefully inadequate to meet the much higher cost of living as a chronically ill and/or disabled person. These types of things are sometimes the only way that someone can afford rent, can afford to move out of a terrible housing situation, to be able to afford a mobility aid, etc. Please do not report these posts as spam. If they bother you, you can filter them out of your feed. And regarding the hashtags used: that is up to the discretion of the member who is posting. They know which hashtags are best for their specific situation.</p>

<p>Blorbo.Social is a community of fandom nerds. </p>

<p>We talk about our favourite <a href=""https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/blorbo_from_my_shows"">blorbos from our shows</a>, create fanart, fanfic, fanvids and other transformative works, and share our weird unique selves. </p>

<p>We follow the <a href=""https://fanlore.org/wiki/The_Three_Laws_of_Fandom"">Three Laws of Fandom</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don’t Like; Don’t Read (DL;DR)</li>

<h2>Explaining the rules</h2>

<p>All members must agree to follow our server rules before they can create an account on Blorbo.Social. This section supplements and explains the official server rules. </p>

<p>If you are not sure whether something is allowable under the rules, check the explanations in this section, or ask <a href=""https://blorbo.social/@admin"">@admin</a>.</p>

<p>If you break the rules, your account may be limited or suspended, either temporarily or permanently.</p>

<p>Admins reserve the right to revoke any user&#39;s access permissions, at any time, for any reason, except as limited by law.</p>

<p>This does not mean you will be limited or suspended over nothing! However, we can’t foresee everything, and there are sometimes edge cases, deliberate skirting around the rules, or other harmful behaviour that we haven’t codified in the rules. </p>

<h3>By joining this server, you assert that you are at least 18 years old</h3>

<p>This is an adults-only community. Members must be 18 or older.</p>

<h3>Use content wrappers (CW) when posting adult content</h3>

<p>We encourage you to share adult, explicit, or not safe for work (NSFW) fanart, fic and other fannish content here. </p>

<p>You must use a content wrapper (CW) or sensitive media checkbox for posts depicting nudity, lewd, sexual, or violent content. </p>

<p>When a media attachment is NSFW, but the text is not, you can select the ‘Mark media as sensitive’ checkbox without also using a CW, if you want.</p>

<p>When the text itself is NSFW, use a suitable CW. (Any attachment under a CW is automatically marked as sensitive.)</p>

<p>Don’t put NSFW content in avatars or headers.</p>

<h3>No lolicon, shotacon, cub, or any similar images</h3>

<p>If you think it’s possible that someone could look at a smutty image and think it depicts an underage person or character, don’t post it here.</p>

<p>Text descriptions of sexual activity by post-pubescent underage characters are allowed, and must be behind a suitable CW. </p>

<p>We use the definition of <a href=""https://archiveofourown.org/tos_faq#content_faq"">underage</a> from Archive of Our Own: “Underage refers to descriptions or depictions of sexual activity by characters under the age of eighteen (18). In general, we rely on authors to use their judgement about the line between reference and description or depiction. Sexual activity does not include dating activity such as kissing, but again, we rely on authors to use their judgment about what is generally understood to be sexual activity. An author may always specify the age of the characters.”</p>

<h3>Do not repost fanworks uncredited, or when the creator has requested no reposts</h3>

<p>We want Blorbo.Social to be a respectful, welcoming space for the people who create the fanworks we all enjoy.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t take credit for someone else&#39;s fanwork, or imply that it&#39;s your own work by posting it without crediting the source. If you post a fanwork without credit, many people will assume that you are the creator. That’s unfair to the actual creator.</p>

<p>Instead of reposting fanworks, we recommend that you link to the creator’s work or boost it. That way, the creator gets to see people enjoying their work, and fans can find more of the creator’s work.</p>

<p>Don’t ever repost fanworks when the creator has specifically asked people not to do that. </p>

<p>It&#39;s usually fine to post uncredited content from official source material, such as screencaps, official art or photos, panels for manga, manhua, etc. Include credits if you can, but don’t stress if you can’t. Most of your fellow fans aren&#39;t going to assume that you&#39;re the creator of the official source material. </p>

<h3>No hate speech, harassment, threats, or incitement of violence</h3>

<p>We don’t allow <a href=""https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech"">hate speech</a> of any kind including, but not limited to, racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, other types of queerphobia, ableism, discrimination based on religion or nationality, body shaming, slut-shaming, or kink-shaming. </p>

<p>We don’t tolerate <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression"">micro-aggressions</a> either.</p>

<p>Don’t harass people on this or any other instance in the Fediverse. Don’t insult people, pick fights, or abuse them, in public or in private. </p>

<p>Harassment includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Attacking or harassing people based on what their opinions or taste in ships or fictional content seems to be. </li>
<li>Inciting dogpiles based on what someone&#39;s opinions or taste in ships or fictional content seems to be.</li>
<li>Posting or reposting call-out posts focused on what someone&#39;s opinions or taste in ships or fictional content seems to be.</li>
<li>Sending someone porn or other sensitive content (written or illustrated) in bad faith with the intent of upsetting them or making them uncomfortable. This includes targeting a known or suspected trigger or squick, but not good-faith social faux pas situations where you genuinely thought the recipient might be interested.</li>
</ul>

<p>If someone asks you to stop contacting them, respect their request and don’t contact them any more. </p>

<p>Don’t threaten anyone with violence or promote any violent ideologies.</p>

<h3>No illegal content</h3>

<p>This includes content that is illegal in your country of origin, and additionally: the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia. </p>

<p>The additional countries listed are due to our host&#39;s Terms of Service (ToS) and the location of some of our moderation staff. </p>

<p>Everything you post here must be legal to post. This includes any Direct post with a privacy setting of ‘mentioned people only’. </p>

<h3>Don’t spread disinformation</h3>

<p>We won’t tolerate people wilfully spreading disinformation. No conspiracy nuts, anti-vaxxers, or anyone who describes other people as &#39;sheeple&#39; who need to &#39;open their eyes&#39;.</p>

<p>COVID is real, vaccinations work, your government almost certainly isn’t injecting you with nanobots, and the earth isn’t flat.</p>

<h3>No spam, scams, corporate advertising, or shilling crypto or NFTs</h3>

<p>Don’t post anything that treats other people as resources to be exploited for profit.</p>

<p>However, if you are an independent creator or a small business, you are welcome to promote your own work or services. </p>

<p>Do you have a book to sell, an Etsy store, or a fan event to promote? Are you an artist open for commissions? Tell us about it! </p>

<p>There is a tradition of mutual aid on parts of the fediverse. You can post occasional mutual aid requests on behalf of yourself or others. </p>

<p>We don’t allow accounts that only post mutual aid requests or promote things for sale.</p>

<h2>Community guidelines</h2>

<p>Our community guidelines are not rules, but instead describe our community norms and recommendations. You don’t have to remember or follow all of them. </p>

<h3>Have fun</h3>

<p>Share your fandom passions, interests, and loves. Tell us about your blorbos. Your love for your blorbos is why Blorbo.Social exists.</p>

<p>Show us your weird unique self. We&#39;re all here because we love our blorbos, but each of us is a complex person with interests other than fandom. You can and should post about non-fandom stuff too.</p>

<p>Be silly, or serious, or both simultaneously. </p>

<p>Tell us what you’re grateful for, what you’re excited about, what worries you, how you get inspired, what keeps you going, what discourages you. </p>

<p>Ask questions. Answer other people’s questions. Cheer others on. If you’re interested in what others are saying or doing, tell them! Human connections make this place special.</p>

<p>Engage with others and make friends, or sit quietly and observe. It’s all good.</p>

<h3>Don’t attack other people’s fun</h3>

<p>Antis are not welcome at Blorbo.Social. If you think that it’s sick and wrong to imagine your favourite fictional characters or celebrities in sexy situations, this is not the place for you. </p>

<p>If you adore Blorbo, but hate the idea of Blorbo in a relationship with OtherBlorbo, put your rants about the BlorbOther pairing behind a suitable CW, and don’t tag it #BlorbOther. People looking at the #BlorbOther tag aren’t (usually) looking for BlorbOther hate. </p>

<p>Be cool about Who Tops and Who Bottoms. It’s okay to have your own preferences, as long as you respect that other people can have preferences different to yours.</p>

<h3>Be kind</h3>

<p>Arguments and disagreements happen. Assume that most people are engaging in good faith, and treat them with kindness and respect even when you disagree with them.</p>

<p>Don’t take offence too quickly when other people disagree with you, or when they have opinions that you don’t like.</p>

<p>Everyone has grumpy days. It’s okay to be grumpy sometimes, as long as “Grumpy Arsehole” isn’t your entire personality.</p>

<p>It’s not okay to consistently bitch and moan, make fun of people, belittle others, or insult them.</p>

<h3>Tag and wrap your posts</h3>

<p>Whenever you post something that someone might have an intense reaction to, it’s considerate to use a CW.</p>

<p>We require CWs (or sensitive media tags) for nudity, lewd, sexual, or violent content. We recommend that you use CWs for spoilers and sensitive content that other people might not want to see right now. Noelle’s guide has some good examples of <a href=""https://github.com/joyeusenoelle/GuideToMastodon#what-does-cw-mean"">when to use CWs</a>.</p>

<p>Be specific in your tags and CWs so that people have a good idea of what to expect when they click. </p>

<p>If you’re describing something that contains NSFW content, but the post itself doesn’t contain the NSFW content, you don’t need to use a CW. For example, you can post a link to an explicit fic or fanart, and describe what people will find there, without having any explicit content in the post itself. We recommend that you still use the NSFW hashtag on posts like these, so that people can filter out these posts if they want.</p>

<p>We have some more guidelines and advice about <a href=""https://paper.wf/blorbosocial/tagging-and-wrapping-your-posts-bgbf"">tagging and wrapping your posts</a>.</p>

<h3>Add alt text to images</h3>

<p>When you post images, <a href=""https://mstdn.social/@feditips/107757781709598274"">add an alt text description</a> to each image, if you can. This helps people with visual impairments, and has other benefits too. Here are some guidelines for writing <a href=""https://kolektiva.social/@glittercleric/109468483571189527"">good alt text</a>.</p>

<p>If you can’t write the alt text yourself, you can tag @imagecaptionspls@a.gup.pe in your post. This alerts a group of volunteers who may write a description for your image.</p>

<h3>Control what you see</h3>

<p>Curate your own experience. Follow people whose posts you like. Search for and follow hashtags for your favourite topics. </p>

<p>Mastodon has many features that enable you to <a href=""https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moderating/"">control what you see</a>. Filter, unfollow, mute and block when necessary. </p>

<p>Sometimes people suck. They might deliberately try to rile you up, act in bad faith, lie or misrepresent facts, or attempt to manipulate you or others. When this happens, it can be hard to step back, but that’s what we recommend. </p>

<p>If the person’s posts are breaking our rules, you can report the posts in question. A moderator will investigate and deal with it.</p>

<p>If you don’t like someone, but they aren’t actually breaking our rules, don’t file a report against them. Just mute or block the person instead.</p>

<h3>Don’t police others’ use of CWs, alt text, or tags</h3>

<p>Whilst we have some guidelines around when to use CWs, alt text, and tags, we only have one rule about them: Use CWs for adult or NSFW content. </p>

<p>You can politely ask other people to use specific CWs, alt text, or tags that you prefer, as long as you don’t state your preferences as absolute rules or requirements. </p>

<p>This is especially important when marginalised people speak about their experiences of marginalisation. For example, if you are not <a href=""https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/BIPOC"">BIPOC</a>, don’t tell BIPOC to hide their experiences of racism behind CWs.</p>

<p>While we strongly recommend that you add alt text to images, it’s not always possible. There are people with disabilities that make it difficult for them to write alt text descriptions themselves. Sometimes accessibility needs are conflicting, and that’s okay.</p>

<p>If other people choose to use CWs, alt text and tags differently to how you’d prefer, that’s up to them. You can always filter, unfollow or block people who post in ways that you don’t like.</p>

<h3>Find another community if this one doesn’t suit you</h3>

<p>This community can&#39;t be all things to all people for all time, and we don&#39;t want it to be. </p>

<p>If at any point you find that Blorbo.Social isn&#39;t a happy place for you, it’s okay to take a break or to leave. Maybe you&#39;re just not that interested in fandom any more, or you&#39;re not feeling the blorbo vibe. </p>

<p>No hard feelings! You can move to another instance that suits you better, or leave the Fediverse entirely.</p>

<h2>Moderation</h2>

<p>Blorbo.Social has a team of volunteer admins and moderators. They manage our community, set our server rules, investigate reports, and take action when people break our rules.</p>

<h3>If you see someone breaking the rules</h3>

<p>If you believe that someone is posting content that violates our rules, report the post in question. Select the three dots (...) on the post, then Report. Include your reason for reporting.</p>

<p>We take all reports seriously. A mod will investigate and decide what to do.</p>

<p>We cannot comment on the outcome of any particular investigation.</p>

<p>If the person seems to be acting in good faith, it’s okay to drop a friendly reminder about the rules, but this isn’t required or expected.</p>

<p>If someone is hostile to you, we recommend that you report their posts, then ignore and block them. If you feel a need to respond and defend yourself, try not to escalate. Remember that responding often inspires harassers to continue their harassment.</p>

<h3>Consequences for Blorbo.Social members</h3>

<p>If you break a rule, a mod will contact you to explain how you broke the rule and what the consequences are.</p>

<p>Consequences can include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A gentle reminder</li>
<li>A warning</li>
<li>Temporarily limiting your account</li>
<li>Temporarily suspending your account</li>
<li>Permanently suspending your account.</li>
</ul>

<p>When deciding on consequences, we consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>The importance of the rule</li>
<li>How hard you broke it</li>
<li>How others are affected</li>
<li>Whether this is the first time or it&#39;s part of a pattern</li>
<li>How you respond to being called on it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Consequences for people on other instances</h3>

<p>If the poster&#39;s account is on a different instance, we may:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do nothing</li>
<li>Reject the person’s media (images, etc) so that they don’t display on our instance</li>
<li>Silence the person, so their posts are no longer visible on our federated timeline and can’t be boosted here (people here can still opt in to follow them) </li>
<li>Suspend the person’s account from our instance, so it’s no longer possible to follow or interact with them from here.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, if we find that the person’s instance accepts behaviour that breaks Blorbo.Social’s rules, we may decide to reject media, silence or suspend the entire instance.</p>

<h2>Federation</h2>

<p>Our moderated servers list is visible to logged-in members only. We have chosen not to publish our reasons for moderating specific servers.</p>

<p>Our general guidelines on federation are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>No limits:</strong> Default. Also applies if we don’t especially like an instance, but they&#39;re not actually breaking any of our rules. </li>
<li><strong>Reject media only:</strong> If they allow Loli/Shota or un-CWed NSFW media but otherwise are cool, e.g. a lot of porn &amp; kinky instances. However, if they also regularly post un-CWed NSFW text, we’ll silence instead.</li>
<li><strong>Silence:</strong> If they don’t follow some of our rules, but also don&#39;t tolerate illegal or harmful behaviour, hate speech, or deliberate trolling. If an instance is struggling to keep up with moderation, we may silence temporarily to give them a chance to fix it.</li>
<li><strong>Suspend:</strong> If they tolerate or encourage harmful activity, harassment, hate speech (TERFs &amp; racists etc), fascists, CSAM, shitty bots, deliberate trolling.</li>
</ul>

<p>This server is dedicated to anyone with an interest in the subjects of ecology and evolution, both professionally and personally. We welcome students, industry scientists, folks working in other fields that have links to E&amp;E, scientific societies, and nature enthusiasts in general. If you want to join us you almost certainly belong, so please apply!</p>

<p>Two ways of signing-up:</p>

<ul>
<li>1) Ask someone already a user to provide you with an invitation link (<code>Parameters &gt; Invite people</code>). This will bypass approval by moderators and would be the preferred way of growing our network.</li>
<li>2) Otherwise, simply follow the <code>Create account</code> button and provide in a sentence or two your relation to Ecology and Evolution. While a website, a program enrolment or a publication record provides a quick confirmation and will allow moderators to work through the queue faster, they are not necessary and we will consider anyone who expresses interest.</li>

<p>Мэтай гэтага сервера з&#39;яўляецца аб&#39;яднанне беларускамоўных карыстальнікаў федэратыўнага сусвету.</p>

<p>[en] <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Server only for Belarusian-language users. </p>

<p>[ru] <strong>ВАЖНО</strong>: Это сервер исключительно беларускоязычный.</p>

<h2>Першыя крокі</h2>

<p>Калі вы ўпершыню ў Мастадоне і не ведаеце як тут што працуе, то вось вам крыху інфармацыі для пачатку:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Асобны Mastadon-сервер (напрыклад наш VKL.world) - гэта як маленечкі кавалак Твітара. Усе гэтыя кавалкі аб&#39;ядноўваюцца ў буйны сусвет, які тут завецца <code>Федэрацыяй</code>. Незалежна ад таго, на якім серверы вы зарэгістраваны, вы можаце ўзаемадзейнічаць амаль з любым ўдзельнікам <strong>Федэрацыі</strong>, дастаткова толькі на яго падпісацца.</p></li>
<li><p>Калі вы толькі зарэгістраваліся, то вельмі добра будзе зрабіць допіс з хэштэгам <code>#вітанкі</code>, у якім напісаць некалькі сказаў пра сябе: адкуль вы, чым займаецеся і чым цікавіцеся. Праз пасты з хэштэгам <strong>#вітанкі</strong> мы знаёмімся адно з адным, ды праз іх можна лёгка шукаць цікавыя акаўнты 😊.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Пасля таго, як вы з усімі павітаецеся, можна пачынаць паўнавартасна карыстацца нашым серверам. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>У стужцы <code>Стужкі -&gt; Тутэйшыя (Гэты сервер)</code> вы знойдзеце допісы мясцовых жыхароў серверу. Толькі беларуская мова, толькі нашыя карыстальнікі.</p></li>
<li><p>У стужцы <code>Стужкі -&gt; Іншыя серверы</code> вы знойдзеце допісы акаўнтаў са знешніх сервераў, на якія падпісаны нашы карыстальнікі.</p></li>
<li><p>У стужцы <code>Стужкі -&gt; Усе</code> змяшчаюцца допісы і тутэйшых карыстальнікаў, і &quot;іншаземных&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Стужка <code>Галоўнае</code> паказвае допісы акаўнтаў, на якія вы падпісаліся. Важна і тое, што ў ёй адлюстроўваюцца і допісы акаунтаў на якія вы падпісаліся па-за межамі нашага серверу, то бок на іншых серверах Федэрацыі. <a href=""https://vkl.world/@itbeard/110658004151096414"">Як падпісацца на акаўнт з іншага сервера</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Стужка <code>Глабальнае</code> паказвае допісы ўсіх акаўнтаў з нашага серверу і допісы акаунтаў на якія падпісаны жыхары нашага серверу з усёй Федэрацыі. Таму ў гэтай стужцы вы часта будзеце бачыць допісы на іншых мовах і з іншых сервераў.</p></li>
<li><p>Стужка <code>Агляд</code> уключае ў сябе допісы, хэштэгі ды спасылкі, якія сістэма аўтаматычна пазначае як папулярныя ды цікавыя на сёняшні дзень. Але шчыра кажучы, працуе яно не заўсёды добра 😁.</p></li>
<li><p>Праглядаць асабістыя паведамленні можна ў стужцы <code>Асабістыя згадванні</code>. Каб напісаць асабістае паведамленне трэба зрабіць допіс, і ў ім адзначыць акаўнт ці акаўнты, якім гэты допіс павінен быць бачны. Далей трэба змяніць тып допісу з <code>Публічны</code> на <code>Толькі згаданыя людзі</code> унізе акенца напісання допісу. Такім чынам гэты допіс пабачаць толькі згаданыя ў ім акаўнты. Менавіта так тут працуюць асабістыя паведамленні, што на пачатку крыху нязвыкла, але вы хутка прыстасуецеся 😊 </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Таксама трэба памятаць, што асабістыя паведамленні ў Mastodon <strong>НЕ ШЫФРУЮЦЦА</strong>, таму не перадавайце праз іх канфідэнцыйную інфармацыю! Больш інфармацыі пра <a href=""https://telegra.ph/YAk-pracuyuc-stuzhk%D1%96-%D1%96-pashyrehnne-kantehnta-%D1%9E-Mastodon-dy-Fedyvyorse-01-28"">працу стужак і бачнасць допісаў можна знайсці ў гэтым артыкуле</a>. Да тагож, усе палітыкі прыватнасці дадзеных карыстальнікаў нашага сервера апісаныя на старонцы <a href=""https://vkl.world/privacy-policy"">&quot;Палітыка прыватнасці&quot;</a>. А гэта <a href=""https://telegra.ph/Pra-byaspeku-%D1%96-pryvatnast-u-Mastodon-01-28"">артыкул пра бяспеку, прыватнаць і рызыкі выкарыстання Mastadon</a>. Раім з усім гэтым азнаёміцца.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Не забывайцеся і пра тое, што можна змяніць <code>мову інтэрфейса</code> серверу, а таксама <code>мову па-змаўчанні</code> для вашых допісаў (маецца на увазе мова, якой сістэма будзе пазначаць вашыя допісы). Усё гэта робіцца ў наладах, якія вы знойдзеце ў меню <code>Параметры</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Важна і тое, што кожны сервер мае свае ўласныя правілы, напрыклад на нашым мы размаўляем выключна па-беларуску 😊. Увесь спіс правілаў серверу VKL.world вы знойдзеце ніжэй, у раздзеле <code>Правілы сервера</code>. </p></li>
<li><p>Калі вы заўважылі, што нехта не прытрымліваецца правіл серверу, то ў вас ёсць магчымасць <code>паскардзіцца</code> на акаўнт ці допіс. Зрабіць гэта можна націснуўшы на трохкроп&#39;е каля допісу ці на старонцы акаўнта, пасля чаго скарга трапляе на разгляд да мадэратараў серверу. Толькі мадэратары серверу бачаць імя стваральніка скаргі.</p></li>
<li><p>Калі нехта з серверу паводзіць сябе так, што гэта вас абражае ці крыўдзіць, але фармальна не парушае правілы, то карыстайцеся функцыямі <code>заблакаваць</code> ці <code>ігнараваць</code> для гэтага акаўнта. У выпадку ігнаравання вы не будзеце бачыць допісы і дзеянні ігнаруемага акаўнта. Блакаванне працуе як і ігнараванне, за выключэннем таго, што заблакаваны акаўнт не будзе мець магчымасці бачыць вашы допісы і дзеянні.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Падаецца, што для пачатку гэтай інфармацыі будзе дастаткова 😊</p>

<p>Problematisches Verhalten kann jederzeit gemeldet werden und wird schnellstmöglich sanktioniert.</p>

<h3>Hosting &amp; Zuverlässigkeit</h3>

<p>Gametoots.de wird von Personen mit jahrelanger Erfahrung im Hosting von Webanwendungen administriert. Die Instanz wird bewusst nicht auf den &quot;üblichen&quot; Servern von Hetzner oder OVH betrieben. Das soll dem Grundprinzip der Dezentralität von Mastodon beitragen.</p>

<h3>Hosting &amp; Reliability</h3>

<p>Gametoots.de is administered by people with years of experience in hosting web applications. The instance is deliberately not run on the &quot;usual&quot; servers of Hetzner or OVH. This is to contribute to the basic principle of decentralization of Mastodon.</p>

<p>Currently the server is hostet by Hetzner in Nuremberg. Elastic Search has also been enabled to enable efficient and easy searching.</p>

<p>A backup of the instance is created every 12 hours and stored geo-redundantly.</p>

Anyone is welcome to join, whether you’re a content creator or a fan, or simply just want to come chat with a bunch of vocalsynth people! For more information on what Mastodon is and how it works, you can <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1793gqQGkImmjWTJU3LR-I8AFtnQNFOvouN-_BUuZzwY"" >read about it here</a> and check out the <a href=""https://docs.joinmastodon.org/"">Mastodon documentation</a>. You can also check out some tips on using Mastodon to its full potential <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kva3zDioSd9ILrhoJODNX47MBYrUoM4kJ8HLh7Gr4xQ"">here</a>!</p>

<p>VocaLounge was made with the following primary goals in mind:</p>

<ul>
    <li>To provide a warm, safe, positive space for vocalsynth community members to socialize;</li>
    <li>To provide a comfortable and accessible space for people to try out Mastodon/fediverse, even if they ultimately choose to migrate elsewhere;</li>
    <li>To help vocalsynth community members, who span a wide range of interests across a wide range of instances, stay connected and accessible to each other.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you like VocaLounge, consider donating to sustain server and hosting costs via <a href=""http://liberapay.com/lystrialle/"">LiberaPay</a> or <a href=""https://ko-fi.com/lystrialle"">ko-fi</a>.</p>

<p>※このインスタンスは主に英語ですが、
お問い合わせの場合、サイト管理者の<a href=""https://vocalounge.cafe/@Lystrialle"">@Lystrialle</a>が日本語で話す事が出来ます。</p>

<p>We are a primarily English-speaking instance, and our moderation team is also English-speaking. We are open to non-English speakers joining or federating with us, but our team may not be able to actively vet non-English content to the same degree we normally would, and in the case of a potential concern we may request external assistance to help translate and interpret. Our web admin <a href=""https://vocalounge.cafe/@Lystrialle"">@Lystrialle</a> also speaks conversational Japanese and will be willing to directly assist in any inquiries relevant to the Japanese side of our community.</p>

<header>
    <h2>Code of conduct</h2>
    <h3>Etiquette</h3>
</header>

<ul>
    <li>Although this is a vocalsynth-themed instance, off-topic posts are fine! Post to your heart's desire about any topic you like, whether it's photos of your cat, or what you had for lunch today, or even fanart of your favorite video game!</li>
    <li>In general, we recommend you make extensive use of hashtags whenever possible, to help others easily find what they’re looking for (ex. #vocaloidart, #vocaloidoriginal, etc.). This especially applies to non-vocalsynth posts, both so that they can federate to other instances, and so that they can be properly caught by user filters.</li>
    <li>Please be mindful of others and use CWs and the “sensitive” media marking for potentially sensitive content, plot spoilers, or anything else that should be kept behind a warning.</li>
    <li>If you expect to be posting a long thread, please consider posting any contents after the initial post as unlisted, to prevent the entire contents of the thread from filling up the timeline without context.</li>
    <li>While we encourage everyone to have fast-paced fun at their leisure, please also be mindful of the local timeline and try not to be overly spammy/disruptive.</li>
    <li>We ask that personal disputes are settled over private conversations when possible, and that users report anything they see in violation of the rules. We also encourage use of the muting and blocking functions to curate their own feed, regardless of whether moderator intervention is requested or not.</li>
</ul>

<header>
    <h3>Prohibited behavior</h3>
</header>

<ul>
    <li>We follow the <a href=""https://joinmastodon.org/covenant"">Mastodon Server Covenant</a>, especially part 1: “Users must have the confidence that they are joining a safe space, free from white supremacy, anti-semitism and transphobia of other platforms.” Therefore, we hold a zero-tolerance policy towards intolerance that would prevent this from being a safe space for our members. Unwelcome harassments or microaggressions of this sort, whether carried out on VocaLounge or outside, will result in removal from the instance.</li>
    <li>In general, we also would like to create a civil atmosphere free of ad hominem attacks, harassment, disrespect, or violations of privacy. Engaging in such deliberate behavior, whether on VocaLounge or outside, in such a way that makes other users feel uncomfortable or threatened, will be subject to disciplinary action.</li>
    <li>Attempts to circumvent disciplinary action by making alternate sockpuppet accounts will result in immediate removal from the instance.</li>
</ul>

<header>
    <h3>Content policy</h3>
</header>

<ul>
    <li>As this is meant to be an all-ages instance, pornography is not allowed. Material potentially NSFW (not safe for work) -- anything you wouldn’t want your parents to see on your screen, including extreme gore/violence -- must be properly kept behind a CW. (For our policy on interacting with instances that may allow 18+ content, see <a href=""https://vocalounge.cafe/about/more#restrictions"">our federation restriction policy</a>.)</li>
    <li>In order to protect the rights of content creators that are so integral to the vocalsynth community, unauthorized reprints or reposts of other people’s work are not allowed. This extends to posting of links that lead to reposted work, as well as usage of art in icons and banners. Willful disregard of this rule, or findings of explicit art/content theft, will result in removal from the instance. We suggest that users use <a href=""https://vocadb.net/"">VocaDB</a> (for videos and audio) or <a href=""https://tineye.com/"">SauceNAO</a>/<a href=""https://tineye.com/"">TinEye</a> (for images) if they wish to properly track down the source for any works they would like to share and recommend to others.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>""Nightcore"" mixes of songs will be considered tantamount to a repost.</li>
        <li>Provided compliance with the policies of the involved parties and companies, posting of official commercial and publicity artwork is allowed.</li>
        <li>Photos of merchandise (official or indie/doujinshi) are considered fair game, although they should be credited when feasible. Sharing photos of artbooks (official or doujinshi) is allowed, but publicly uploading scans of them will be considered piracy and subject to removal.</li>
        <li>We will not request removal of works uploaded by a user authorized to post them (for instance, commissioned art or authorized reposts). We will generally hold good faith that people claiming authorization have indeed acquired the necessary permissions, but we will honor any artists' requests to have their work taken down if they object to its presence here.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>As our community is dependent on the resources and creations supporting us, many of which come from small independent creators, public advocacy of piracy and links to or instructions for downloading pirated material are not allowed and will be subject to removal.</li>
    <li>Usage of materials or works in ways that violate the original creator's usage policy (e.g. unauthorized edits or usage of MMD models against their original terms of usage) will be subject to removal and potential disciplinary action.</li>
    <li>As per the culture of our community, we are naturally friendly towards fanwork, but we reserve the right to take down material at the request of the original work's creator.</li>
    <li>Bots that cycle posts (i.e. post the same thing at set intervals) must post them as unlisted or followers-only; they may not be posted to the local timeline. (If your account is a dedicated bot, we recommend you make it on <a href=""https://botsin.space/"">botsin.space</a> instead.)</li>
    <li>Automated crossposts from Twitter (such as with the <a href=""https://crossposter.masto.donte.com.br/"">Mastodon Twitter Crossposter</a> or <a href=""https://moa.party/"">Moa Bridge</a>) are fine, but crossposting for Twitter retweets and quotes must be disabled (for various reasons, including high potential for reposted artwork). Failure to comply may result in silencing (removing an account from view of anyone not following it) or disabling of the account's functions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our moderation team will do everything within the range of feasibility to monitor VocaLounge's environment and ensure rule compliance; however, since we are ultimately a bunch of humans and cannot realistically catch everything at once (especially from the federated feed), we ask that our users please assist us in reporting rule-violating content in order to bring it to our attention.</p>

<p>We will treat users possessing good faith with respect and sympathy, and actively work with them to ensure rule compliance. We also understand that there may be ""borderline cases"" where subjective judgment about rule adherence will be required. In said cases, final decisions will be left to the moderation team.</p>

<header>
    <h2>Federation</h2>
    <h3>Federation with VocaLounge</h3>
</header>

<p>We recognize that vocalsynth community members come from a diverse range of backgrounds and hobbies, and that some will likely want to be connected to our instance from a different one. We have a <a href=""https://vocalounge.cafe/@ambassador"">federation ambassador</a> account designed to help vocalsynth community members from other instances federate into our instance; following it will allow them to appear in our federated feed, and making their hashtagged posts searchable to VocaLounge users. Please note that as of this writing, this account is manually operated, and will follow back in accordance with VocaLounge rules.</p>

<p>We are actively friendly towards other vocalsynth-centric instances (such as <a href=""https://vocalodon.net/"">Vocalodon</a>). If you are an admin or moderator of one, or are interested in making one, please contact one of our administrators (<a href=""https://vocalounge.cafe/@Lystrialle"">@Lystrialle</a> or <a href=""https://vocalounge.cafe/@MystSaphyr"">@MystSaphyr</a>) if you are interested in discussing interaction between our communities. Due to our community's roots in music and art, we are also actively friendly towards other creative and artistic instances and are happy to discuss any inquiries about federation or community interaction.</p>

<p>We also hope to ensure that content from our instance does not cause problems for other instances, and our admins are happy to converse with the staff of other friendly instances in the hopes of maintaining good relations.</p>

<header>
    <h3>Restrictions</h3>
</header>

<p>Mastodon provides us with a variety of functions to place differing levels of restrictions on content coming from certain instances, ranging from requiring click-through to see media from an instance, to hiding an instance’s posts user from direct view to anyone not following them, to outright blocking anything coming from an instance. In most cases, we wish to encourage content to freely flow to and from our instance and throughout the fediverse, allowing people’s works and ideas to branch out into the world. However, our priority is first and foremost to continue maintaining the safety of our users who may not wish to be accidentally exposed to something harmful to them without warning, and to maintain VocaLounge's nature as a safe space.</p>

<p>If we determine at any point that an instance actively cultivates a culture of hate speech or content that is threatening to our users, to the extent that affiliation with said instance fundamentally indicates affiliation with said culture, we will immediately block off communication to and from the instance. We will block off communication with any instance with moderation that does not sufficiently regulate users from stealing or reposting content from ours, violating our users' privacy, or otherwise abusing their ability to interact with our users. We will also immediately block off servers or users with a central dedicated theme of content that would violate our policy.</p>

<p>While we will not necessarily discourage interaction with people from instances with less stringent rules than ours, we recognize that said disparity may, in practice, lead to fundamental differences in said instances' cultures, and that federation and interaction will often lead to unchecked exposure of said cultures to our users and our users to theirs. We will continue to monitor interaction with said instances in order to ensure everything that enters VocaLounge is compliant with our own rules. If we notice a high likelihood of rule-violating content coming in unchecked, we may place various restrictions to slow down interaction with our instance or block media to prevent server storage of media potentially against our rules. If we determine that an instance has a repeat track record of harassment, poses a fundamental danger to our community climate, or threatens the safety of our users, we may, as a last resort, eventually escalate to blocking off communication with the instance entirely.</p>

<p>Our moderation team is dedicated to actively moderating server interactions and ensuring a balance between good communication while not potentially damaging our community health, and is committed to taking action depending on what we consider to be necessary for the safety of our users and our user community. If you have any concerns about the content coming from a particular instance, or concerns about any restrictions we've placed on a particular instance, please let a moderator know so we can look into what can be done.</p>

<p>This server aims to provide a safe space for 18+ furry ABDLs who identify with any age, be they babyfur, kidfur, teenfur, caretaker, and so on! This server is open to anyone who partakes in or is curious about the furry ABDL community. All fluffies, scalies, and humans are welcome, crinkling not required! However, expect to see many types of crinkly critters, their photos, and their art on this instance.</p>

<p>Please be aware that this <em>is</em> an ABDL/babyfur space and as such our Content Warning policy around ABDL material may be more relaxed than other furry servers.</p>

<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Our name is cubhub.social but cub porn is NOT allowed.</em>
<hr /></p>

<h2>Why The Name?</h2>

<p>I picked the name &#39;CubHub.social&#39; because, despite the current negative connotation around the word &#39;cub&#39;, CubHubs were the first places at furry conventions I felt safe being an ABDL while also coming to grips with my furry side. For those who don&#39;t know, CubHubs are private rooms/party rooms that serve as safe spaces for babyfurs, kidfurs, diaperfurs, etc at conventions. Before ABDLs were as accepted into the fandom as they are now, CubHubs were the only place where it was absolutely safe to be yourself. So, yeah, I couldn&#39;t think of a better ethos to bring to the Fediverse. I want CubHub to be a safe space on Fedi for all fuzzy ABDLs.
<hr /></p>

<h1>Content Warnings &amp; Moderation</h1>

<h2>Content Warnings</h2>

<p>We require warnings on certain types of material posted in both text posts and image posts.</p>

<h3>FAQs for Content Warnings on Media:</h3>

<p>This list is <strong>not</strong> exhaustive. These are simply the CWs we get asked about the most. Please read the Rules Section below for a more general but comprehensive list.</p>

<h4>No Content Warning Needed:</h4>

<ul>
<li>ABDL Clothing </li>
<li>Clean or Soggy Diapers </li>
<li>SFW ABDL/Furry Art</li>
<li>Fursuits</li>
<li>Pup Hoods and Harnesses if Clothed Underneath</li>
<li>Light/Cutesy Age Regression or Hypnosis</li>
<li>Diaper Pats/Play Swatting</li>
</ul>

<h4>Content Warning Needed:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Political Posts</li>
<li>Depictions or Detailed Descriptions of Drug/Alcohol Use</li>
<li>Nudity or Sex/Yiff</li>
<li>Leaking or Messy Diapers</li>
<li>Watersports/Wetting Through Clothes</li>
<li><em>Obvious</em> Erections Under Clothing/Tented Diapers</li>
<li>Murrsuits With Genitalia Showing</li>
<li>Heavy/Extreme Bondage</li>
<li>Needles</li>
<li>Heavier Age Regression or Hypnosis (unwilling subjects, mental destruction-- use your best judgment here since it&#39;s a gray area)</li>
<li>Spanking/Red Cheeks/Impact Play</li>
<li>Every story post regardless of whether it&#39;s SFW just so users know what they&#39;re reading before they do.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Recommended But Not Required</h4>

<ul>
<li>ABDL/Furry Fandom Discourse</li>
<li>Photos Cropped to a Diapered Crotch/Butt</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note: You cannot use content warnings too much! If you&#39;re on the fence or you&#39;d rather CW a post even if it&#39;s not required, we recommend that you do so. It also helps when users follow you who may not be into the same subject matter as you are!</em></p>

<h2>Content Warning How-To</h2>

<p>There is a ⚠️ button under your post compose box. When clicking on it, it&#39;ll open a new text box that&#39;ll let you fill out a description of the post content.</p>

<p>When tagging, be concise but also descriptive of the contents of the post. Examples being, don&#39;t say &#39;NSFW&#39; but instead try &#39;Messy Diapers&#39; or &#39;M/M Yiff&#39;. Similarly, don&#39;t say &#39;News&#39;, try &#39;US Politics, Elections&#39; to help out non-US users. </p>

<p>Content warning moderation isn&#39;t particularly strict. If your post is missing a Content Warning, a staff member will usually mark it as sensitive and ask that you add CW tags to it. If the user doesn&#39;t respond to the request, a moderator will delete the post and let the user redraft it with the CW&#39;s included. Repeatedly failing to use CWs will result in a time-out and your video games taken away.</p>

<h2>Moderation</h2>

<p>Failure to adhere to the server rules may lead to something as simple as a warning, up through content removal, silencing, and a ban. If you feel action taken against you was incorrect, you may appeal the action to the administration. However, we have a zero tolerance policy for hate speech or pro-fascist imagery of any kind, and it will result in an immediate ban with no appeal. <em>Nazi symbols, Confederate imagery, Pro-Russian invasion of Ukraine, and Blue Lives Matter talk are all unwelcome here.</em></p>

<h2>Reporting Posts</h2>

<p>If a post violates our rules, we ask that users fill out a report for the moderation staff. Please do not confront other users directly.</p>

<h3>Reporting Posts from Other Instances</h3>

<p>If a post from another server appears in our federated timeline and has content that breaks our rules, please report it! If it&#39;s art that&#39;s simply missing a CW, a moderator can mark it as sensitive. If it&#39;s something more egregious, the user or even the instance can be limited or defederated from us. </p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> Please do <strong>not</strong> select the &quot;Forward to [instance]&quot; option in the report unless you verify that the post breaks the rules of their home server as well. Servers have different rules and what may be inappropriate here may be entirely appropriate elsewhere!
<hr /></p>

<h1>Tips &amp; Tricks</h1>

<h2>Hashtags</h2>

<h3>Using Hashtags</h3>

<p>Using hashtags immensely boosts the visibility of your posts! Because there are no algorithms, it&#39;s up to users to find the content they want to see. As such, using hashtags makes discoverability much easier. <code>#FurryArt</code>, <code>#ABDLArt</code>, or <code>#BabyfurArt</code> are all hashtags people are following and will mean your post will be seen by more users.</p>

<h3>Following Hashtags</h3>

<p>Mastodon allows you to follow hashtags so you can have any posts tagged with a hashtag show up in your Home timeline. To follow a hashtag, type the hashtag you want to follow in the search box then hit the follow button in the top right corner.</p>

<h2>Roleplaying</h2>

<p>As our community has such a large roleplaying community, we recommend users indicate whether or not they roleplay in their profile. Users looking to roleplay should check the profile of the person they&#39;re interacting with to see if they&#39;re up for it and ask if they&#39;re unsure.</p>

<h2>Image Accessibility</h2>

<p>When posting images, we implore all users to include a description of what is in the image by providing alt text. To add alt text, click the edit button while you&#39;re posting your picture and fill in the details under &quot;Describe for the visually impaired&quot; and save it. This really helps users with accessibility needs! Many Mastodon users will only boost images with alt text, so it&#39;s a good habit to get into.</p>

<h2>Markdown In Posts</h2>

<p>You can use Markdown in your posts by clicking the icon below the compose box that looks like a sheet of paper, then clicking <code>Markdown</code>. You can set your posts to default to Markdown by going into your <code>Settings &gt; Preferences &gt; Other &gt; Default format for toots</code> and selecting <code>Markdown</code>. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re new to markdown, try this <a href=""https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus"">Markdown Tool</a> here.</p>

<h2>Federation</h2>

<p>Any user you follow from another instance will then federate with our server. This means any and all posts they make will appear on our federated timeline, unless the server has been limited (see the Moderated Servers section below).</p>

<p>If a user/post isn&#39;t federated with us that you want to follow/like/boost, you can copy the link to the user/post into the CubHub search box and our server will federate it, thus allowing you to interact.</p>

<h2>CubHub Interface Tweaks</h2>

<p>Our server runs a version of Mastodon based on <a href=""https://github.com/Taullo/Ruffy"">Ruffy</a> that&#39;s a fork of <a href=""https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs/"">Glitch-Soc</a>. Ruffy has a two-column theme, customizable accent colors, emoji reactions, and much more.</p>

<p>To see all of the available options to tweak the look of CubHub, click the two cog wheels in the top right of the desktop interface, or <code>Interface settings</code> in the overflow menu of the mobile interface on the bottom right!</p>

<h2>Mobile Apps</h2>

<p>While the default Mastodon mobile app is <em>good enough</em>, it&#39;s missing features that are custom to CubHub. To this end, we recommend that Android users use either <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.joinmastodon.android.sk&pli=1"">Megalodon</a> or <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.joinmastodon.android.moshinda"">Moshidon</a>. From there, users can go to <code>Overflow Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Instance</code> and turn on <code>Enable post formatting</code>, <code>Enable emoji reactions</code>, and <code>Server supports local-only posting</code> and make sure <code>Glitch local-only mode</code> is off.
<hr /></p>

<h1>Server Information</h1>

<h2>Transparency Pledge</h2>

<p>We want to run this instance with as much transparency as possible. Please, if users have any questions at all, contact anyone on the moderation or administration staff. If there are any moderation questions, technical questions about the server, and so on, we&#39;d be more than glad to answer them.</p>

<h2>The Server&#39;s Longevity</h2>

<p>A lot of users have concerns about admins abruptly shutting down their instances and the users losing what they&#39;ve built. CubHub is completely and utterly committed to keeping the server going long-term and continuing to be a place for furry ABs, DLs, middles, grown-ups, etc to congregate. However, in the event of something catastrophic, here is our pledge:</p>

<ol>
<li>If the admin is unable to continue to administrating the server, the server will be handed over to someone the community has approved of running the instance.</li>
<li>If a replacement can&#39;t be found, the server will remain up for <strong>at least</strong> 30 days from the initial notice of closure, so users can migrate their content and their followers to a new instance with plenty of notice.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>A Note From Rusty: This is like some worst case scenario stuff, but I want people to feel safe hosting their content here and know there&#39;s a backup plan in the event of catastrophe. I love running this instance and I love this community and I really don&#39;t wanna go anywhere!</em></p>

<h2>Server Costs</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Server Host:</strong> $72.00 Monthly</li>
<li><strong>Daily Backups:</strong> $10.00 Monthly</li>
<li><strong>S3 Storage:</strong> ≈$2.00 Monthly</li>
<li><strong>Domain Registrar:</strong> $46.16 Yearly</li>
<li><strong>Email Server:</strong> $95.00 Bi-Yearly</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note: Our S3 storage hosts things like our pictures, videos, and other media. It tends to fluctuate and should very slowly climb in cost over time, though likely not by much.</em></p>

<h2 id=""cross-posting"">
    Cross-posting
</h2>

<p>
    ""Cross-posting"" is the automatic copying of posts from one platform to
    another. That definition does <strong>not</strong> include the simultaneous
    posting to multiple platforms from the same app, such as Twidere or
    PostyBirb. If you use those apps, we consider those posts original, and the
    following need not apply.
</p>

<p>
    Cross-posting from Mastodon to other platforms is fully permitted.
    <strong>
        Cross-posting into Mastodon from another platform is permitted under
        the following terms:
    </strong>
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        The posts do not include platform-specific references, e.g. talking
        about ""here"" meaning Twitter, or including text from other non-Mastodon
        users verbatim (e.g. cross-posted quote tweets)
    </li>
    <li>
        The account is at least semi-regularly monitored by the author, so that
        interactions from Mastodon users are not ignored
    </li>
    <li>
        The account being cross-posted is owned by the same person. Third-party
        copying of content is not permitted
    </li>
</ol>

<p><em><strong>NOTE</strong>: Please read the &quot;Joining VT Social&quot; section below before applying, or we may reject your application.</em></p>

<p>VT Social is a fediverse instance for VTubers run by VTubers. Our goal is to provide a space for VTubers and VTuber-adjacent content creators, so we can connect with each other and have a place for fans to discover our content.</p>

<h2>About us</h2>

<p>VT Social is run by <a href=""https://vt.social/@lina"">Lina</a>, a tech VTuber with a passion for VTuber technology and empowering everyone to be a VTuber. She spends most of her time working on open source GPU drivers, and also has experience with systems administration. She decided to start this instance to provide a place for all other VTubers to gather together! ✨</p>

<p>Our instance is based on the glitch-soc fork of Mastodon, which adds things like better notification controls and the ability to use formatting in posts (our own fork is <a href=""https://github.com/nullptr-live/vt-social"">here</a> and it&#39;s based on the <a href=""https://gitea.treehouse.systems/treehouse/mastodon"">Treehouse</a> version, in case you&#39;re curious!). Over time, we plan to modify Mastodon to add better tools for VTubers to share their content and allow others to find it.</p>

<p>This instance is hosted on our own hardware at a data center, and we have plans for expanding it and scaling it to be able to host everyone! We know VTubers love to post images and videos, so we are especially committed to having enough storage for all of you, starting with over 10TB of space right off the bat and able to scale up! Right now the instance is still on default settings for upload limits, but we will be optimizing it and customizing it to give everyone better options soon.</p>

<p>The VT Social logo is based on a concept by <a href=""https://vt.social/@koda/109302016376315527"">K.O.D.A.</a>, itself inspired by the nullptr::live logo by <a href=""https://twitter.com/soundflora"">soundflora*</a>.</p>

<h2>Rules and guidelines</h2>

<p>Please see our instance rules below for the official policy, but in summary: we want VT Social to be a friendly space for all VTubers free of harassment or abuse. We&#39;re all in this together trying to have a good time and connect with fans and supporters, and we hope you are too! Here are a few guidelines to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be friendly with fellow VTubers! Light-hearted rivalry is okay, but don&#39;t let it escalate into name-calling or attacks. We all want to coexist together, not fight!</li>
<li>Be respectful of others&#39; identities and styles. VTubing gives us the power to be whoever we want to be - embrace it for yourself and for others!</li>
<li>Don&#39;t discuss the IRL identities of other VTubers, including speculation. This is considered on par with doxxing! Let&#39;s respect each others&#39; privacy!</li>
<li>Don&#39;t sexualize others or make advances on them without consent. Many people aren&#39;t comfortable with that!</li>
<li>Tag all R18/NSFW content as sensitive, and add a CW if necessary (e.g. gore). Do not direct suggestive/NSFW content at minors, nor involve minors or minor-presenting personas in such content.</li>
</ul>

<p>This instance allows R18/NSFW images, but all such content <em>must</em> be tagged as sensitive, and you should add CWs as necessary. The line for what counts as NSFW varies by culture, but we expect all content depicting sex acts (censored or not) or genitalia to be marked as such. We recommend that users who frequently post such content enable the &quot;Always mark media as sensitive&quot; option under Preferences → Other, and accounts primarily aimed at an 18+ audience must clearly mention &quot;18+&quot; in the bio. If you repeatedly fail to mark media as sensitive, we will mark your account as enforced-sensitive.</p>

<p>We do reserve the right to use our own judgement in difficult cases, and may ask you to tone it down or remove certain content if we think it is necessary. And although we hope to never have to resort to it, if we ever have to ask someone to leave the instance, we will give them enough time to use the Fediverse migration tools to move their account and followers to another instance.</p>

<h2>Joining VT Social</h2>

<p>VT Social is open to all VTubers and content creators who work with them! To make sure the people on the instance are genuine creators, we ask that you prove who you are and show that you are an active content creator.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you are a VTuber, you need to have at least 2 stream VODs or videos using your avatar (2D, 3D, PNG) totaling at least 1 hour of content.</li>
<li>If you are a VTuber-related content creator or illustrator, you need to have created official content/illustration work for one or more VTubers at least two times, or be actively involved in a VTuber-centric creation or development project. VTuber managers are also welcome.</li>
<li>Illustrators with a focus on VTuber fanart are also welcome, as long as it is a significant part of your work and welcome by the VTubers you draw (memes don&#39;t count!).</li>
</ul>

<p>These are not hard rules, and we are open to being flexible as long as you are part of the VTubing community!</p>

<p>In order to prove that you are who you say you are, please add your desired username (@someone@vt.social) to a website or social media page you control, and link it when you request an account on the instance (bio, tweets, subpages, posts, files on a domain, etc. are all fine). When you request an account, please tell us:</p>

<ul>
<li>A little bit about yourself and what you do (just one sentence or two is enough)</li>
<li>A link to your verification post/page (you need to mention your VT Social username there!)</li>
<li>A link to your existing content</li>
<li>If you are a manager or otherwise associated with a VTuber, a link that we can use to verify your relationship</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Please post a tweet or make mention of your application on your socials, so we can verify who you are!</strong> Something like &quot;I&#39;m joining VT Social at @myusername@vt.social&quot;, or even just &quot;I&#39;m applying for a VT Social account!&quot; if you use the same username on both sites is all we need. You can also add your @myusername@vt.social ID to your bio instead. Please link to the post/tweet/bio when you apply, and tell us what you did if it&#39;s not obvious, so we can verify you quickly! This helps us make sure the person creating the account is not an imposter claiming to be you.</p>

<h3>What if I&#39;m just getting started and I don&#39;t have any content yet?</h3>

<p>No worries! You can sign up on any other instance, and then, once you have some content, move to VT Social! Mastodon and the Fediverse allow you to move your account over and bring all your old followers, and make sure anyone who lands on your old account gets redirected to your new one.</p>

<h3>What about fans?</h3>

<p>Thanks to the awesomeness of the fediverse, you can connect with fans hosted on any other instance! We want to focus on the content creators themselves, so that we can help fans discover their content and find new VTubers to follow all in one place, as well as connect together VTubers and artists, modelers, riggers, and more. We think we can do a better job by working to make the best instance for creators, instead of having a general-purpose instance where anyone can sign up.</p>

<h2>Federation policy</h2>

<p>VT Social federates with everyone by default, and we only preemptively defederate instances in egregious cases (e.g. instances run by known serial harassers or openly hosting and condoning hate groups). However, we do expect all instances to have basic moderation and rules forbidding harassment. If we receive multiple reports from users of an instance, and it does not appear to have such rules nor be moderated appropriately, we will defederate it in order to protect our users. If you admin such an instance and have corrected the situation, please email lina@asahilina.net in order to request to have federation reinstated.</p>

<h3>Content legality and CWs</h3>

<p>VT Social is hosted in Japan and subject to Japanese law. We recognize that there are certain classes of content on other instances which many users may not wish to see, and which may vary in legality in other countries. For instances which host large amounts of such content without the appropriate CWs or sensitive tags, we may use media restrictions to effectively mark such media as sensitive in public timelines. We plan to work on our own improvements to Mastodon in the future, to provide finer-grained controls so that we can ensure we don&#39;t create unnecessary divisions between communities while empowering our users to decide what kinds of content they wish to see, and balance their own risk of exposure to unwanted content. At VT Social, we expect our own users to use sensitive tags and CWs appropriately, and have stricter policies for content on the instance as mentioned above.</p>

<p>HypnoGuys is a Mastodon server focused on guys who are into
hypnosis, including (but not limited to) erotic applications.
This is also commonly known as &quot;erotic hypnosis&quot; or &quot;hypnokink&quot;.
You do not have to be interested in hypnosis to join this server,
but you must understand and accept that hypnosis is the theme
of this server.</p>

<h1>Gendered Space</h1>

<p>HypnoGuys is a gendered space: as the name implies, this server is focused on
guys. People of all genders and sexualities are allowed to use this server, as
long as they understand that &quot;guys&quot; are the focus here. If you are looking for
a Mastodon server focused on hypnosis <em>without</em> this focus on guys,
<a href=""https://mastodon.triggerphra.se"">Triggerphrase</a> is an excellent
option.</p>

<p>Note that sex and gender discrimination is not allowed on this server. Despite
being a gendered space, HypnoGuys does not put down people who are not guys.</p>

<h1>Content Warnings (CW)</h1>

<p>Mastodon provides a &quot;content warning&quot; feature, where users can gate their
posts behind a short piece of text, warning potential readers of what they
are about to encounter. Content warnings (or CWs) must be used for content
that involves explicit sex, such as fucking.</p>

<p>However, not all erotic content requires a CW on this server. Generally
speaking, we follow the example set by the popular
<a href=""https://woof.group"">woof.group</a> Mastodon server: anything that you might
see in a leather bar is perfectly acceptable and does <em>not</em> require
a content warning.
Flirting, groping, jockstraps, boobs, butts, moderate impact, pup gear: no CW necessary.
If you&#39;d take it to the back bar or the playroom, use a CW.
Genitals, piss, fucking, fisting, piercing, scat: CW please.</p>

<p><a href=""https://blog.woof.group/docs/"">Check out the documentation for woof.group to see more about this policy.</a></p>

<h1>Banned content</h1>

<p>You may not post the following content on HypnoGuys:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sexual content involving minors, including artistic depictions</li>
<li>Gore and extremely graphic violence, including artistic depictions</li>
<li>National Socialism</li>
<li>Nazism</li>

<li>Sex and gender discrimination</li>
<li>Transphobia</li>
<li>Misogyny</li>
<li>Pro-ana / Pro-mia</li>
</ul>

<h1>Banned activities</h1>

<p>You may not engage in any of the following activities on HypnoGuys:</p>

<ul>
<li>Automated sharing of third-party content, news sources, websites or social
media content that doesn’t belong to you</li>
<li>Repeated trolling, insulting or derogatory comments towards others, even
after they ask you to stop</li>
<li>Mass following and aggregation of content</li>
</ul>

<h1>Approved content</h1>

<p>As long as you don&#39;t violate any of the above rules, you may post any content
you want on HypnoGuys, whether related to hypnosis or not. In addition, here
are some examples that are explicitly approved, and <em>do</em> belong on this
server:</p>

<ul>
<li>Discussions of hypnosis, including hypnotherapy and erotic hypnosis</li>
<li>Media related to hypnosis (such as spirals, art, photo manipulations, audio,
video, etc) that you own, or that the owner has provided written permission
for you to post</li>
<li>Advertising professional services related to hypnosis</li>
<li>Explicit sexual content, <em>with an appropriate <a href=""https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/posting/#cw"">content warning</a></em></li>

<p>This space is designed for ND (dx, self-id/dx, or questioning) folks to find each other and connect in a space that is welcoming.</p>

<p>Please read the rules.</p>

<h2>About the server</h2>

<h3>Who is welcome on Neurodifferent.me?</h3>

<p>This space is designed for ND folks to find each other and connect in a safe space that is welcoming.</p>

<p>We support self-identification/diagnosis as these are often inaccessible due to cost, biases and other factors. Questioning people are welcome. Many of us found our way to diagnosis by seeing ourselves reflected back through others experiences.</p>

<p>Note: We are an intersectional space, and just because one may not personally share an experience someone else does, does not give us the right to silence or invalidate others voicing of their own experiences, even if it makes us uncomfortable.</p>

<h3>Content Warnings</h3>

<p>Content Warnings (CW) are an integrated part of mastodon, and provide a method for people to choose to protect topics that may be sensitive. If you feel that something may be sensitive, or spoil someone's experience (eg. sharing about a TV show), you are encouraged to post using a CW.</p>

<p>Note: Users will not request other users to suppress aspects of their intersectional identities, and related experiences, behind a CW. No user should have to suppress their own identity in order to avoid complaints, reports or harassment by others.</p>

<p>Note: There is a setting in your preferences to open all posts with Content Warnings automatically, if you don't want to click through each one.</p>

<h3>Image descriptions</h3>

<p>It is an expectation of this instance that you add accurate descriptions to images and video that you post to aid in accessibility. (A description like ""image.jpg"" that does not aid in accessibility would not meet this expectation.)</p>

<p>If you post an image of a screenshot of text, it is an expectation of this instance that you transcribe the text in the image description.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of all users to remind each other about descriptive text, so that this is an accessible space for all.</p>

<h3>Behaviours that may result in a ban</h3>

<p>Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, queerphobia, able-ism, etc. (may result in a permanent ban, you may not receive a prior warning)</p>

<p>Misuse of reporting mechanisms to target marginalized individuals.</p>

<p>Serious dishonesty that is hurtful to others.</p>

<p>Impersonating other people.</p>

<p>Harassment of any kind.</p>

<p>Accounts that automatically repeat a Twitter account, RSS feed, etc. must post as Unlisted, not Public.</p>

<h3>Abuse / Weaponization of moderation/reporting</h3>

<p>Do not attempt to weaponize our anti-abuse/reporting tools/policies against other marginalized groups.</p>

<p>We are an intersectional space, and just because we may not personally share an experience someone else does, does not give us the right to silence or invalidate others voicing of their own experiences, even if it makes us uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Attempts to re-centre discussions of marginalized people around the feelings of the privileged will be taken as manipulative behaviour undertaken in bad-faith. (E.g. white people should not demand that Black people put CW's on every discussion of race or a straight person who reports a queer person for writing ""I dislike straight people"".)</p>

<p>This is a Mastodon instance for the discussion of Astronomy and related space-sciences. We welcome all humans with an interest in discovering the nature of the universe, whether you&#39;re just starting out on your journey of discovery, whether you have a class of stellar object named after you, or if you&#39;re somewhere in between.</p>

<p>Real names and credentials are only recommended if you plan to use your account on this instance for networking purposes; they are absolutely not required.</p>

<h2 id=""encouraged-uses-of-astrodon-social"">Encouraged uses of Astrodon Social</h2>

<ul>
<li>Share your discoveries.</li>
<li>Highlight the beauty and majesty of the cosmos. Awe-inspiring images and media are strongly encouraged, espeically if it&#39;s your own work!</li>
<li>Ask questions, and answer questions asked. The power of our community is in sharing.</li>
<li>Network with other #Astrodons. Collaborate on studies, organise star parties, make friends.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=""discouraged-uses-of-astrodon-social"">Discouraged uses of Astrodon Social</h2>

<p>The following will result in: a warning from a moderator or having offending posts deleted, possibly without prior notice.</p>

<ul>
<li>Providing unsolicited advice to strangers. </li>
<li>Inappropriate un-CW&#39;d posts on the Local Timeline (see below for CW policies)</li>
<li>Posts with un-described images or video</li>
<li>Posts of other people&#39;s work without proper attribution</li>
<li>Shortened links, e.g. bit.ly, t.ly, tinyurl.com, goo.gl, ift.tt, lnkd.in, is.gd or t.co (These are considered malicious because link-shorteners track users without their consent and obscure the destination address, which also prevents users from being able to decide whether they want to visit the link beforehand)</li>
<li>Advertisement or commercial content of any kind.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=""content-warnings-cw-s-"">Content Warnings (CW&#39;s)</h2>

<p>This community is founded on the principle of using informed consent to allow community members to decide which content they wish to engage with. To help inform others of what your post contains, we use Content Warnings. There is no stigma attached to using content warnings - they're a courtesy to your fellow Astrodons.</p>

<p>Please add CW&#39;s (content warnings) that are accurate and descriptive enough to enable reader consent to the following types of posts:</p>

<ul>
<li>strong language,</li>
<li>rants,</li>
<li>selfies,</li>
<li>current events (includes: US or non-US, local, national, international, and should be applied regardless of whether sources are academic or non-partisan),</li>
<li>high-conflict or otherwise exhausting issues of popular debate (e.g. techbro billionaires, privacy issues, elections, etc.),</li>
<li>mentions of death or violence,</li>
<li>references or links to Facebook/Twitter/other big tech companies,</li>
<li>spoilers of popular and recent TV shows or other media,</li>
<li>ASCII art (this one is important to ensure that someone using a screen reader doesn&#39;t have to listen to an attempt to read out a bunch of obscure symbols)</li>
<li>stress sources, particularly complaints about personal life, work, academia, and study.</li>
<li>anything else where another user might want to decide for themselves whether or when they want to interact with your post.</li>
</ul>

<p>Established science is not considered triggering or stressful. We welcome posts on any scientific subject, but please use hashtags Content Warnings to help your fellow Astrodons to identify content they want to engage with.</p>

<p>There is a setting in your preferences to open all posts with Content Warnings automatically, if you don&#39;t want to click through each one.</p>

<h2 id=""image-descriptions"">Image descriptions</h2>

<p>It is an expectation of this instance that you add accurate descriptions to all images and video that you post to aid in accessibility. (A description like &quot;image.jpg&quot; that does not aid in accessibility would not meet this expectation.)</p>

<p>If you post an image of a screenshot of text, it is an expectation of this instance that you transcribe the text in the image description.</p>

<p>It is required that if you are reposting images or media that is not your own, the source is fully attributed both in your post and in the image description.</p>

<p>Posts on the Local Timeline (ones with the &quot;Public&quot; privacy setting) will be checked to ensure that Content Warnings are applied, images are described, and other expectations are followed. Unlisted posts will not be proactively reviewed, but will still be subject to rules regarding abuse and other hate-speech.</p>

<p>NOTE: The &quot;official&quot; Mastodon app is NOT recommended for use on Astrodon Social, as it does not allow for posting using the &quot;Unlisted&quot; privacy setting.</p>

<p>Use a CW if you&#39;re not sure that your post is &quot;on-topic.&quot; Astrodon Social is not meant to be a current events news aggregator, and if your post seems to fall into this category, you may be asked to delete and re-draft it with a CW or as an Unlisted post. Let&#39;s try to avoid turning the Local Timeline into the same rehashing of the outrage-of-the-day that we see on Twitter!</p>

<p>Not <em>every</em> post on the Local Timeline should be CW&#39;d, but most should. Do your best to try to accommodate each other, and try to be understanding when there is a clash of expectations or needs.</p>

<h2 id=""bots-and-automated-accounts"">Bots and automated accounts</h2>

<p>Whilst the community is growing, bots and automated accounts are not allowed on this instance. As the community establishes in the coming weeks this restriction will be reviewed to allow for automated posting. </p>

<p>To be clear: cross-posting from other social media accounts that you use as an individual is perfectly okay, and a good way to manage multiple accounts whilst keeping your sanity.</p>

<h2 id=""regarding-attempts-to-abuse-these-anti-abuse-tools-and-policies"">Regarding attempts to abuse these anti-abuse tools and policies</h2>

<p>Do not attempt to weaponize our Community Standards or anti-abuse tools/policies against marginalized groups such as people of colour, women or queer people. Users of Astrodon  Social are expected to have the literacy to understand that &quot;reverse discrimination&quot; is not real, and so attempts to re-centre discussions of marginalized people around the feelings of the privileged will be taken as manipulative behaviour undertaken deliberately in bad-faith. (E.g. white people should not demand that people of colour put CW&#39;s on every discussion of race; a straight person who reports a queer person for writing &quot;I hate straight people&quot; may find their own account suspended.)</p>

<p><strong>Journa.host is the home for working journalists and news outlets on Mastodon.</strong> It caters to active &amp; retired journalists, scholars in media studies, and a variety of journalism adjacent professionals.</p>

<p>In October of 2023, the Fourth Estate Public Benefit Cooperative undertook the oversight of Journa.host, ensuring the platform&#39;s sustained growth and relevance, while upholding its core values and objectives.</p>

<p>Hosting and management of Journa.host is handled by<a href=""https://honeytreetech.com"">Honeytree Technologies</a>. </p>

<p>The financial requirements for Journa.host are fulfilled through community support, primarily via crowdfunding on <a href=""https://opencollective.com/journahost"">Open Collective</a>, a certified 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. </p>

<p>Administrative and supplemental support services are provided by the Fourth Estate PBC.</p>

<p>Journa.host is currently closed to new account registrations.</p>

<h2>Journa.host History</h2>

<p>Journa.Host started as a community-centric project with initial funding sourced from The Tow-Knight Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY. A dedicated team of journalists meticulously managed it, aiming to benefit the broader news community. </p>

<p>Prominent founding moderators included:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Adam Davidson, the genius behind NPR’s &quot;Planet Money&quot; and former contributor to The New Yorker and The New York Times Magazine. Contact: <a href=""mailto:adamdavidson@journa.host"">adamdavidson@journa.host</a></li>
<li>  Todd A. Price, a key reporter for the USA Today Network’s southern division. Email: <a href=""mailto:tprice504@journa.host"">tprice504@journa.host</a></li>

<p>Our commitment to truth, dependability, and authenticity remains unwavering. Measures are in place on Journa.host to verify the credentials of journalists. Membership on the platform symbolizes one&#39;s status as a verified journalist. Professional journalists looking to join are invited to apply.</p>

<h2>Moderation Policy</h2>

<p>We have a  <strong>balanced</strong>  moderation policy that encourages a free press and free journalistic expression and speech while enforcing rules against extremist, prohibited, and/or illegal content.</p>

<p>Hate speech is not tolerated. This includes racism, misogyny, transphobia, homophobia and religious intolerance such as anti-semitism. This list is illustrative but not exhaustive.</p>

<p>Our aim is to maintain responsible free expression while ensuring a safe and inclusive community for all users. Our moderation approach focuses on  <strong>behavior</strong>  that occurs on the journa.host platform.</p>

<p>You can report violations directly from an individual post, image, or profile, including spam, abusive or harmful content, inappropriate ads, self-harm, and impersonation.</p>

<p>When making a report, please make sure to include at least a few posts that demonstrate prohibited behavior. If there is any additional context that might help make a decision, please include it in the comment as well.</p>

<p>We handle most reports within  <strong>72 hours.</strong></p>

<p>Please note that we do not comment on moderation actions, and you will not be notified when a report you have made has led to moderation or other action.</p>

<p>Additionally, not all punitive actions are externally visible. For first-time offenses, we may choose to delete offending content, escalating to harsher measures for repeat offenses.</p>

<p>Appeals and feedback channels are available for members.</p>

<p>You must be aged 13 years or older to register for an account. We do not require you to use any particular language whilst using the service. </p>

<h3>Brands</h3>

<p>The Blower is a community, not a billboard or a bullhorn. As such, we do not allow brands to register accounts. Brands are invited to join another instance or create their own – try <a href=""https://brands.town"">brands.town</a>. Use these guidelines for what we consider a Brand:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you are a for-profit business, you are a brand</li>
<li>If you are a political party, you are a brand</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are unsure whether you are a brand, please email <a href=""mailt:admin@theblower.au"">admin@theblower.au</a> to sort it out before registering.</p>

<h3>Bot accounts</h3>

<p>Bot accounts (i.e., those with automated posting) are permitted on The Blower under these additional conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Post privacy must be set to &quot;unlisted&quot;, &quot;followers only&quot; , or &quot;direct&quot;</li>
<li>The “This is a bot account” checkbox must be set in the profile.</li>
<li>The account must identify the bot owner in the bio.</li>
<li>Bots must not interact with (mention) other accounts unless those accounts have interacted with the bot first.</li>
</ul>

<p>We reserve the right to refuse or revoke any user&#39;s access permissions, at any time, for any reason, except as limited by law.</p>

<h2>User Code of Conduct (Rules)</h2>

<p>The following types of content will be removed, and will result in account suspension and revocation of access to the service:
Registering accounts with inherently malicious intent.</p>

<ul>
<li>Unauthorised distribution of any personal information or data (DOXing).</li>
<li>Impersonation: You may not impersonate individuals, groups, or organisations in a manner that is intended to or does mislead, confuse, or deceive others. While you may maintain parody, fan, commentary accounts, you may not do so if the intent of the account is to engage in spamming or abusive behaviour. (Parody accounts must be labelled as such in the bio).</li>
<li>Nude or pornographic images, or other content that would be considered &quot;18+&quot; or &quot;adult&quot; by a reasonable person under Australian law</li>
<li>Any conduct intended to incite other users to perform any of the aforementioned actions, is also disallowed.</li>
<li>Racism or advocacy of racism.</li>
<li>Queerphobia, or advocacy of queerphobia (comparisons to paedophilia, animals, dehumanising language)</li>
<li>Sexism or advocacy of sexism.</li>
<li>Anti-sex worker perspectives or advocation against sex workers.</li>
<li>Discrimination or advocation against genders and sexual minorities.</li>
<li>Homophobia, Biphobia &amp; Transphobia (Trans Rights are Human Rights).</li>
<li>Ableism, fatphobia or discrimination against disabled people.</li>
<li>Xenophobia and/or violent nationalism.</li>
<li>Gore and extremely graphic violence, including artistic depictions.</li>
<li>Promotion or encouragement of suicide or self-harm.</li>
<li>Stalking; including advocating any physical, sexual, or emotional harm against individuals or groups.</li>
<li>Harassment of any kind, including consistent baiting, bad faith gaslighting, unwanted sexual advances, etc. especially towards marginalised groups.</li>
<li>Promotion of scams, including web3/crypto and other ponzi schemes.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following types of content are explicitly disallowed and will result in revocation of access to the service:</p>

<ul>
<li>Conduct promoting the ideology of National Socialism (Seriously. Absolutely no Nazis!).</li>
<li>Holocaust denial or Nazi symbolism, or similar content illegal in the state of Victoria, Germany, Switzerland and/or France.</li>
<li>Violence: You may not make specific threats of violence or wish for the serious physical harm, death, or disease of an individual or group of people. This includes, but is not limited to, threatening or promoting terrorism. You also may not affiliate with organisations that — whether by their own statements or activity both on and off the platform — use or promote violence against civilians to further their causes.</li>
<li>Child exploitation: You may not post (or promote) suggestive depictions of children in any way (regardless of context). Example: No bath photos</li>
</ul>

<h2>Content Warning (CW) Guidelines</h2>

<p>We encourage the use of Content Warnings (aka Content Wrappers, aka Summaries, aka Topics, aka Subject lines, hereafter CWs) on your posts. CWs are a courtesy to your readers and other members of The Blower community. CWs are not self-censorship: they do not suppress the indexing of posts, only their initial visibility. </p>

<p>The Blower believes that CWs are an important tool to support people&#39;s self-autonomy, but they can also be used for expression and creativity.</p>

<p>CWs are not expected on posts made by marginalised people about their own marginalisation, though authors may choose to do so.</p>

<h2>Safety and Moderation</h2>

<p>We strive to be a welcoming, and safe instance. Mastodon has safety features such as word/hashtag filtering to limit visibility to unwanted content, and we encourage the use of  block/muting other accounts rather than engaging in vitriolic arguments. Please make use of the ability to report accounts that break the rules.</p>

<p>Please report users who break following the code of conduct, but please do not message people on behalf of the moderation team. Instead, you can scroll on, block, mute, or report to let moderators deal with it.</p>

<p>We will <strong>not act</strong> on complaints regarding:</p>

<ul>
<li>Criticising racist, sexist, or otherwise oppressive behaviour or assumptions.</li>
<li>Good faith and non-malicious conduct whose object is to ameliorate (improve) the conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups.</li>
<li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you”.</li>
<li>Swearing or profanity.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Blower is one of many Fediverse communities, each with their own rules, moderation, and ethos. You are able to move servers in the future without losing your followers if this instance turns out to not be the best place for you.</p>

<p>I. Adatkezelői adatok
● Adatkezelő: Kovács Béla (a továbbiakban: Adatkezelő)
● Web: www.magyarmastodon.com
● E-mail cím: civilmedia@gmail.com
● Telefonszám: + 36 70 661 0319
II. Az adatkezelés jogalapja, célja, az adatkezelés időtartama, a kezelt személyes adatok
köre
II./1. Ismertető a www.magyarmastodon.com webhelyen használt sütikről
II./1./a, Mik azok a sütik?
A sütik (HTTP-cookies) kis információcsomagok, melyeket a szerver küld el a felhasználók számára, melyet a webböngésző program
(pl. Google Chrome, IE, Firefox) ment el a számítógép merevlemezén. Így weboldalak böngészése közben, vagy a weboldalak
bezárását majd újra megnyitását követően a felhasználók számára fontos információkat a szerver el tudja érni. Így fontos beállítások,
pl. egy bevásárlókosár tartalma egy webáruházban nem vész el, a webhely „emlékszik” az adatokra, nem szükséges azok ismételt
megadása. A sütik elfogadása nélkül a weboldal egyes funkciói nem fognak megfelelően működni.
Bővebb technikai információ: https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP-s%C3%BCti
II./1./b, Milyen feladatra használ sütiket a www.magyarmastodon.com webhely?
● Kosár tartalma: a kosár tartalmát sütik segítségével jegyzi meg a webáruház. Ha a vásárlás előtt Ön elnavigál az
oldalról, később visszatérvén a kosárban megtalálja a kiválasztott termékeket. Élettartama: 30 nap
● SESSION-azonosító süti: a kosárba került tételekről a szerveren indult munkamenet tárolja az adatokat. A
munkamenet azonosító kódját a SESSION azonosító süti tartalmazza. A munkamenet a vásárlás befejeztével,
vagy a böngésző bezárásával automatikusan megszűnik.
● Sütik elfogadása: amennyiben Ön a sütik elfogadásra gombra kattint ezt is sütik segítségével jegyezzük meg,
hogy a későbbiekben ne jelenjen meg a sütik használatára vonatkozó figyelmeztetés a lapok alján. Élettartama: 1
év
● Vásárlók beazonosítása: amennyiben Ön a vásárlás során bejelöli a „Kérem az adataim megjegyzését a jövőbeli
rendeléseim megkönnyítéséhez” opciót az adatok az Ön számítógépén, http-sütik segítségével kerülnek
feljegyzésre 1 évig.
II./1./c, A sütik törlése
Természetesen egyes sütik (pl. a bevásárlókosár tartalmáért felelős) értelemszerűen törlődnek, amikor használatuk már feleslegessé
válik (pl. vásárlás befejezése). Ettől függetlenük Ön is törölheti a sütiket, ha törli a böngészési előzményeket. Pl. Google Chrome
esetén: Beállítások &gt; Előzmények &gt; Böngészési adatok törlése (beikszelve a „Cookie-k, illetve webhelyek és beépülő modulok egyéb
adatai” adatmezőt). A sütik törlésével kapcsolatban további útmutatót az alábbi weboldalakon talál

<p>Please keep the following in mind when signing up:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your request should be at least one complete sentence, in English.</li>

<li>Ensure that your chosen username is appropriate for the server, this will be your public username, and changing it will require creating a new account.</li>
</ul>

<p>What to expect:</p>

<h2>Community Guidelines</h2>

<h3>Self Promotion</h3>

<p>Self promotion is allowed and welcome! </p>

<p>For example, you are free to announce:</p>

<ul>
<li>sale of prints, pins, or other crafts</li>
<li>release of games or albums for sale</li>
<li>availability for work commissions</li>
<li>crowdfunding campaigns</li>
<li>employment opportunities</li>
</ul>

<p>However, <strong>sunny.garden</strong> is a place for <em>people</em>, it is not a job network, advertising platform or storefront. </p>

<p>Operate your account as yourself, a human being (probably?), and do not engage in unsolicited or excessive marketing or promotion.</p>

<h3>AI Art Policy</h3>

<p>&quot;AI Art&quot; refers to images generated using <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-to-image_model"">text-to-image models</a> such as Midjourney and Stable Diffusion. </p>

<p>The issue is not with the technology, but with the current implementation of these tools being trained on the works of many artists without their consent, attribution, or compensation.</p>

<p>You may post images containing AI Art for comment, discussion, etc. provided that you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mark the post with the hashtag #AIArt for clarity and ease of filtering.</li>
<li>Mark the media as sensitive, or use a content warning.</li>
<li>Do not sell AI art.</li>
<li>Do not use AI art as your avatar or profile image.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are free to post or sell:</p>

<ul>
<li>Art generated with tools such as <a href=""https://processing.org/"">Processing</a>, fractals, or other types of procedural generation which do not rely on training from existing artwork.</li>
<li>Art generated using models trained exclusively on images that you own or are public domain, in which case you should indicate this is the case to avoid confusion.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>This policy applies to sunny.garden users only, please do not report users on other servers which may have different policies.</em></p>

<h3>Reporting</h3>

<p>If you encounter harassment or inappropriate content, please use the reporting functionality built into Mastodon (click the three dots icon [...] on posts or profiles). Reporting helps the moderators be aware of, and take action against, sources of harassment and unwanted content for the benefit of everyone on the server.</p>

<h2>Federation Policy</h2>

<p>This server blocks (&quot;Suspends&quot;) other servers that allow content -- such as harassment and hate speech -- that violates our rules.</p>

<p>The full list of suspended servers can be viewed at the bottom of the About page, but of particular note:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://hub.sunny.garden/2023/07/05/meta-coming-to-the-fediverse/"">This server blocks Facebook&#39;s Threads service.</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://hub.sunny.garden/2023/06/28/what-does-authorized_fetch-actually-do/"">This server has Authorized Fetch enabled.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Reliability</h2>

<p>This server commits to the <a href=""https://joinmastodon.org/covenant"">Mastodon Server Covenant</a></p>

<ol>
<li>Active moderation against racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia</li>
<li>Daily backups</li>
<li>At least one other person with emergency access to the server infrastructure</li>
<li>Commitment to give users at least 3 months of advance warning in case of shutting down</li>
</ol>

<p>However, there are no guarantees. While our best efforts are made to provide a reliable server, uploaded media and posts may be lost due to technical malfunction, accidental erasure, and so on. Always keep your own backups of any content you wouldn&#39;t want to lose.</p>

<p>In the event that the current admin(s) of this server are no longer willing/able to operate the server (due to cost, time, health, lack of interest, etc.) then they will do their best to find a replacement admin with similar values, who is willing to take over the operation of the server, before considering shutting it down.</p>

<h2>Customizations</h2>

<p>This server runs a mostly standard installation of Mastodon, but there is one functional customization:</p>

<ul>

411,637b305bd94dca7f11e7b7ab,nnia.space,False,1438,"<p>NNIA stands for Non Normative Identities Alliance, a group for marginalized and stigmatized demographics. The purpose of the movement is promotion of health and support for these people, public awareness in absence of shame and thought policing.</p>

<p>NNIA was introduced as a concept on MAP twitter in 2019, as an attempt to find a common ground between the MAP community, the other paraphiliacs, queer people who don't want to discriminate against others, mentally ill people. We all have to live being stereotyped as predatory and less than human, and it's time to unite and make our voices heard.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of NNIA as a server is to connect people of marginalized identities who are under threat of silencing and erasure on mainstream social media and give them a space to talk and a feeling of stability. This is not a discussion platform between paraphiliacs and antis. However, polite and rational questions from occasional viewers are welcome.</p>

<p>Application rules:<p/>
<p>- introduce yourself;<p/>
<p>- explain why you're interested in us.<p/>
<p>Blank applications and unspecific applications (“I want to check it out”, “I want to meet people”) will be rejected. This is a site for minorities and supporters of minorities, so please, indicate that you understand it and want to be a part of it.<p/> 
<p>Things you need to know:</p>

<p>1. Mastodon is a network of servers, each with its own staff, that permits anyone from any server to interact with anyone from any other server. This server is ours. But you can go chat with people from elsewhere.</p> 

<p>2. You are going to have 3 timelines. Home timeline will give you everyone you follow, Local will show everyone from NNIA whether you follow them or no (but only original posts, no replies), Federated will give you all content our members interact with, from any Mastodon server.</p>

<p>3. You can regulate the degree of privacy of your posts. The globe icon that appears below the text as you write indicates public posting. You can change it by clicking on it.</p>

<p>4. We as admins have access to everyone’s emails, and we’re not going to abuse this knowledge, but we recommend getting separate mails for map activities anyway. We no longer log IPs, but a VPN, such as Proton VPN, or Betternet, is still recommended.</p>

<p>5. There are Mastodon mobile apps. Tusky for Android and Tootle for Apple are the most popular ones.</p>

<p>6. The mod group watches members of other servers that interact with us. In case of any dangerous behavior (attempts to solicit illegal materials, doxxing threats, aggressive bigotry), their accounts will be banned from interacting with this server.</p>

<p>7. Google emojis on this site are modified from <a href=""https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji"">Noto Emoji</a> and licensed under the <a href=""https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji/blob/main/LICENSE"">Apache 2.0 License</a>. © 2013 Google, Inc. All Rights Reserved</p>

412,637b305fd94dca7f11e7b7b9,wobbl.xyz,False,1006,"<h2>General Information</h2>

<p>Mastodon instance for furries of the larger, tubbier persuasion. Generally focused on fatfur and related content, while also just being a place to post whatever you want (within reason naturally).</p>

<p>In an attempt to curb spam accounts the site has been set to require approval for registration. These will be reviewed ASAP.</p>

<p>This is a federated server and is relayed to several other furry Mastodon instances.</p>

<p>Any servers reported as abusive/trolling will be blocked to maintain stability of this instance.</p>

<h2>Moderation Team</h2>

<p>Wobbl.xyz is moderated by:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://wobbl.xyz/@tarrien"">@tarrien</a> - Admin/Owner</li>
<li><a href=""https://wobbl.xyz/@thesammon"">@thesammon</a> - Moderator</li>
<li><a href=""https://wobbl.xyz/@SnowBlueHusky"">@SnowBlueHusky</a> - Moderator</li>
</ul>

<h2>Content Warnings</h2>

<p>Mastodon/Wobbl.xyz does not force the use of content warnings (CWs); however, using them is a cultural norm of the platform. On Mastodon, the words &quot;content warning&quot; don&#39;t automatically mean that a post is NSFW and they&#39;re not synonymous with &quot;trigger warning.&quot; They&#39;re just tags which tell people what kind of content is in a post, and they can be better thought of as &quot;spoilers&quot; or &quot;content notices.&quot; Mastodon also allows users to filter posts on keywords contained in CWs to avoid certain content, and it indexes CWs for searching. The goal of CWs is to prevent surprises and make posts easier to discover.</p>

<p>Posts from Wobbl.xyz are sent to other federated instances through boosts and the Federated Timeline. An excess of posts without CWs or with vague CWs may cause other instances to defederate (block) us, so please use CWs where appropriate.</p>

<p>Here are some content warning tags that you can use as a starting point:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>SFW</strong>, <strong>NSFW</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Body types like: <strong>Fat / Fat Fur, Muscles / Muscular, Thin</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Sizes like: <strong>Blob</strong>, <strong>Immobile</strong>, <strong>Hyper</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Kinks like: <strong>Healthplay, Slob, Sweat, Weight Gain, Transformation</strong>, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nudity / Genitals</strong> (and additional specifics like <strong>Bulge</strong>, <strong>Vagina</strong>, <strong>Penis</strong>, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Furry Art</strong>, <strong>IRL</strong>, <strong>Belly Photo</strong>, <strong>Gainer Talk</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Example Content Warning: <strong>Furry Art, Fat Fur, SFW</strong></p>

<p>We also ask that posts seeking financial help or donations (such as GoFundMe campaigns) are tagged with the content warning <strong>Financial Aid Request</strong> or <strong>Mutual Aid Request</strong>.</p>

<p>This is not an exhaustive list. Fun/silly tagging is allowed and so are other tags not listed above; we just request that you are descriptive about the contents of your posts and be mindful of people who use filters. </p>

<h2>AI Art</h2>

<p><strong>Wobbl does not allow the posting of AI generated art.</strong></p>

<p>We define AI art as art that is fully or primarily generated by a neural network AI art generator (i.e. DALL-E).</p>

<p>The reason we are choosing to ban AI art is because these platforms generally use scraped art assets and images for their data models without proper copyright attribution or compensation to the original artists. We polled the Wobbl community and received a large response in favor of the ban.</p>

<p>The Wobbl team considers the current iteration of these platforms as theft and plagiarism of copyrighted works of artists, and currently there does not appear to be a way to mitigate this glaring issue. We value the importance of artists in the furry community and choose to support them against this major threat. As technology is always changing, this policy will be updated as necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Our moderation approach for AI art will be to ask the poster to remove it themselves. If further action is needed, we will keep record of such. Multiple infractions without cooperation with the moderation team may lead to suspension.</p></li>
<li><p>We cannot police the posts of other instances when it comes to things like this. Please don&#39;t report posts from other instances with AI art to us.</p></li>
<li><p>We do not consider the use of AI tools in the creation of art to be an issue (i.e. artists using tools to generate backgrounds, fill spaces, etc.). This ban applies to art that is primarily/completely generated by AI models.</p></li>
<li><p>As with any other rule or policy, we ask our members to refrain from going after those who do post AI art. If you see it posted to Wobbl, feel free to report it, but there is no reason to demonize people. Doing so is against Rule #5.</p></li>
<li><p>We understand there is value to AI generated art, the technology does have benefits. We apologize to those who may be impacted by this policy decision, however we refuse to host such content.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>CW Policy FAQs</strong>

<ul>
<li><em>&quot;Why is my topic not listed?&quot;</em>

<ul>
<li>This is a short list of tags most common for this instance, it is not exhaustive. Please feel free to use any other tags that you feel are appropriate to your post.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>&quot;XYZ shouldn&#39;t have to come with a warning, why is it on there?&quot;</em>

<ul>
<li>Please keep in mind that these are for describing and tagging your content more than &quot;warning&quot; about it, this allows users here and elsewhere to view what they specifically want to more easily and filter out what they don&#39;t.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>&quot;What if I don&#39;t want to use CWs?&quot;</em>

<ul>
<li>Wobbl.xyz and Mastodon in general don&#39;t require CWs, however they are expected and appreciated. If you would rather not tag your posts at all, one option is to change your default posting privacy setting to &quot;Unlisted&quot;, so your posts don&#39;t get pushed directly to the global timeline.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>&quot;What if I see a post from Wobbl.xyz that isn&#39;t properly tagged?&quot;</em>

<ul>
<li>Please keep in mind this is a community, and behind each user is a person. If you want to civilly and kindly point it out to them, there&#39;s nothing wrong with that. If you are not able to do so for whatever reason, or would rather not, you may report the post and the site&#39;s admin team will investigate instead. Otherwise you are always free to mute/block them and move on.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>&quot;What if I see a post from a different instance that isn&#39;t properly tagged?&quot;</em>

<ul>
<li>If it bothers you, mute/block and move on. We are all adults on this instance (per the rules), and should be able to compose ourselves as such.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>General Instance FAQs</strong>

<ul>
<li><em>&quot;What does it mean when you say you&#39;re &quot;federated with multiple furry servers&quot;?&quot;</em>

<ul>
<li>Mastodon allows servers to connect to each other so we can interact with people on multiple servers. Federating with furry servers means we have it set up where the public posts from those servers we&#39;re connected to, as well as public posts from Wobbl.xyz, all go into a shared &quot;Federated&quot; feed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>&quot;Who can I reach out to for assistance?&quot;</em>

<ul>
<li>Anybody listed under the Administered By: section above can assist.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>&quot;Do I have to sign up to Wobbl.xyz to be able to interact with people on this instance?&quot;</em>

<ul>
<li>No! As long as you have a Mastodon account on a server that we haven&#39;t blocked for some reason, or haven&#39;t blocked us, you should be able to interact.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>&quot;If this is just some small community space, what&#39;s stopping you from suddenly disappearing and shutting down one day?&quot;</em>

<ul>
<li>Sadly, very little, however Wobbl.xyz has made a committment to offer at least a 30-day warning if we do choose to shut down for some reason. </li>
</ul></li>

<p>
FediScience is a community for active scientists. Establishing the exact definition of ""science"" and who is actively contributing to it is a long-standing open problem (<a hred=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarcation_problem"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarcation_problem</a>). 
</p>

<p>
Therefore, we need to fix a criterium. We have opted to assume that researchers currently publishing in scientific journals are active scientists, knowing the potential limitations of this definition. To register on FediScience, you'll need to provide us with evidence that you are working as a publishing scientist or aspiring to be one, by sending us a link to your ORCID, academic web page, or similar where we can see your contributions. We will not save or use this information for anything other than the verification process. For students or junior researchers who have not yet published a paper - no problem! Just explain your situation. It will help us if you can add a link where we can see that you are affiliated with a research institution.
</p>

<p>
Other edge cases will be moderated on an individual basis. If you really think that you are a good match for the FediScience community, please apply and carefully explain your situation.
</p>

<h2>About Fediscience.org</h2>

<p>FediScience is a social network for publishing scientists. Everyone is welcome to join from PhD student to professor, as well as researchers from outside of academia. You are welcome to stay afterwards, but it is also easy to change to another server.</p>

<p>There will be a lot of science talk on this server, but there is no need to only talk science.</p>

<h2 id=""code-of-conduct"">Code of conduct</h2>

<p>As many people as possible should feel welcome at FediScience, so please follow the code of conduct.</p>

<ul>
<li>You do not have to give your name, but please tell us about your expertise and interests in your bio and introduce yourself using the #introductions hashtag.</li>
<li>Don’t do anything that’s illegal in Germany or where you live.</li>
<li>We want to be inclusive; do not engage in exclusionary behaviour or language. Consider not only the current interaction, but how it would be if your behaviour were common.</li>
<li>Don’t harass people. Respect it if people want to stop an interaction. Sexual attention can constitute harassment, even if it wasn’t intended to cause upset.</li>
<li>Please relax. Don’t assume you know better than the person you’re talking to.</li>
</ul>

<p>Users violating these rules may have their accounts suspended and will not be welcome to take part any more.</p>

<p>If you are subject to or observe any harassment, or have any other concerns, please report the toot concerned or message a moderator. Reports will be dealt with discreetly and in confidence.</p>

<p>We want everyone to have a great time and treat each other with respect.</p>

<h2>Use of the Content Warning (CW) feature</h2>

<p>Mastodon has Content Warnings, please use them. They can be used to collapse a long (series) of messages, but also to hide topics some may find upsetting, especially when people would not expect this kind of content in your stream, e.g., when you are not talking about your area of expertise.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the message editor you can click the ""CW"" button; anything in the small warning field above your larger message editor field will be visible. The reader will have to click on ""Show more"" to see the full message.</p>

<h2>Use of bots and cross-posters</h2>

<p>It is fine to use apps or services which generate toots automatically, but please make sure that you have them under control: make sure they are relevant, try to limit it to a few posts a day. Mark the account as bot. When using bots and cross-posters visit FediScience regularly, if only to interact with replies.</p>

<h2>Support Mastodon and FediScience</h2>

<p>The best way to help is to spread the word! If you starting using Mastodon and find it useful then help out by telling other people about it.</p>

<p>Multiple people have kindly offered to support FediScience financially and since we are getting so many new people onboard that we can make use of the funds to support the infrastructure and moderation costs.

<p>This server supports translation, so it is ok to post in other languages than English. But, as English as the primary language here, that should ideally be the primary language you use. If you do post in other languages, please tag your posts with the appropriate language label.</p>

<h3>Will you ban me for X?</h3>

<p>We will take appropriate moderation measures against any violations of the Code of Conduct. We also reserve the right to take actions in the best interest of the community in situations we deem harmful but do not clearly violate the Code of Conduct. We will generally lean towards promoting free expression and issuing warning and restrictions rather than bans, but this is absolutely not a free-speech-above-all platform.</p>

<h3>How can I help cover costs?</h3>

<p>You can support us on <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/sigmoidsocial"">Patreon</a> or <a href=""https://ko-fi.com/sigmoidsocial"">Kofi</a>!</p>

<h3>How can I share suggestions for Sigmoid Social?</h3>

<p>You can message The Gradient via Mastodon, email, Twitter, or pigeon.</p>

<h3>Where is my data stored?</h3>

<p>Sigmoid Social is hosted by <a href=""masto.host"">MastHost</a>, a fully managed Mastodon hosting service provided by WAP – Web Access Platforms. WAP is a one-person company 100% owned and administrated by Hugo Gameiro. All data storage and processing is done through MastHost.</p>

<h3>What happens if The Gradient can no longer maintain Sigmoid Social?</h3>

<p>In the case that our current team can no longer run Sigmoid Social, we will attempt to transfer control of it to another non-profit entity within the AI community. If we are unable to do this, we will announce the closure of Sigmoid Social within at least 30 days to allow users to transfer their accounts to other Mastodon instances.

<h3>Can you access my private DMs?</h3>
<p>The only way we can access private communications from Sigmoid Social is through exporting the database stored by MastoHost. We will do this periodically for the purpose of storing backups, and in case we have to migrate to another hosting solution. We <b>will not</b> inspect the database for any other reasons. Regardless, we recommend not sharing any private or secure information on this platform.</p>

<h3>What is your policy in AI Art and NFTs?</h3>

<p>This instance is a great fit for anyone who wants to post AI art - we fully support it. We are also OK with NFT promotion, as long as it relates to AI art and is not spammy.</p>

<h3>Why does the banner spell out ""Sigmioid""</h3>

<p>We generated our banner using MidJourney (a text-to-image AI tool), and intentionally picked out an image that contained a typo as a little in-joke about these tools.</p>

<h2>Recommended Practices & Mastodon tips</h2>

<p>Here are some recommended practices for helping make Sigmoid Social a great place for everyone here:
<ul>
<li>Browse the local feed when starting out. Mastodon has three types of feeds: home (people or hashtags you follow), local (all posts from this instance), and federated (all posts from this instance and any users from other instances that are follow by anyone on here). Until you follow some people or hashtags, the local feed is your best bet for discovering content.</li>
<li>Use hashtags. Mastodon does not have an algorithmic feed, so hashtags are often used for finding content relevant to your interests. So, using hashtags will make it easier for others to find and follow you, and for you to find others as well. We list a set of recommended hashtags below!</li>
<li>Use the unlisted privacy setting in replies and threads. The default post privacy in Mastodon is &#39;global&#39;, which gets posted to the local timeline, whereas &#39;unlisted&#39; is only shown when browsing the replies to a given post. Using unlisted for most replies and threads makes the timeline less cleaner and nicer to browse.</li>
<li>Look into the non-official apps for Mastodon. There are some apps not made by Mastodon that provide an arguably better frontend. Examples include Tusky and Toot!</li>
<li>Consider using content warnings/content labels. The CW button when writing posts stands for &#39;content warning&#39;, and then you include one in your post only the text for it is shown unless a user presses a button to see the rest of the post. We recommend using it for sensitive content, but you can also use them like a subject line or TLDR as well!</li>
<li>Explore Mastodon notification options. Mastodon allows you to mute various types of notifications, which can make it easier to focus on just replies and ignore favorites or boosts if you prefer to do so.</li>
<li>Report any content you think might violate the code of conduct. Moderation on Mastodon primarily relies on the users reporting objectionable content, at which point our mods can take care of it. Reporting bad content will make the experience on Sigmoid Social better for everyone!</li>
<li>Aim to be generally civil and friendly :) 
</ul></p>

<h3>Hashtags</h3>

<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>Sigmoid Social is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone.</p>

<p>We want this community to maintain a fun, pleasant, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. In keeping with these aims, we do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from Sigmoid Social at the discretion of the organizers of the Gradient.</p>

<p>Harassment, including the following activities, will not be tolerated:</p>

<ul>
<li>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.</li>
<li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.</li>
<li>Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names.</li>
<li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate.</li>
<li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like ""hug"" or “backrub“) without consent or after a request to stop.</li><li>Threats of violence.</li>
<li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.</li>
<li>Deliberate intimidation.</li>
<li>Stalking or following.</li>
<li>Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.</li>
<li>Sustained disruption of discussion.</li>
<li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
<li>Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others. Sigmoid Social is intended to be a welcoming platform, so while friendships in support of research are encouraged, note that Sigmoid Social is not a dating platform. Flirting or other unprofessional behavior may make someone uncomfortable. If a member requests another member to stop this type of behavior and it continues, it will be considered harassment.</li>
<li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.</li>
<li>Deliberate ""outing"" of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.</li>
<li>Publication of non-harassing private communication.</li>
<li>Impersonation with the intent to deceive users (satire is ok).</li>
<li>Explicitly rude or degrading remarks in general.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id=""reporting"">Reporting</h3><p>If you are being harassed by a user of Sigmoid Social, notice that someone else is being harassed, believe confidentiality has been violated, or have any other concerns, please report this via the standard Mastodon tools. We will respond as promptly as we can.</p>

<p>organizers reserve the right to exclude people from Sigmoid Social based on their past behavior, including behavior outside  Sigmoid Social.</p>

<p>We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of the members Sigmoid Social or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.</p>

<h3 id=""consequences"">Consequences</h3>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from Sigmoid Social and identification of the participant as a harasser to other members of Mastodon.</p>

    Cross-posting
</h2>

<p>
    ""Cross-posting"" is the automatic copying of posts from one platform to
    another. That definition does <strong>not</strong> include the simultaneous
    posting to multiple platforms from the same app, such as Twidere or
    PostyBirb. If you use those apps, we consider those posts original, and the
    following need not apply.
</p>

<p>
    Cross-posting from Mastodon to other platforms is fully permitted.
    <strong>
        Cross-posting into Mastodon from another platform is permitted under
        the following terms:
    </strong>
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        The posts do not include platform-specific references, e.g. talking
        about ""here"" meaning Twitter, or including text from other non-Mastodon
        users verbatim (e.g. cross-posted quote tweets)
    </li>
    <li>
        The account is at least semi-regularly monitored by the author, so that
        interactions from Mastodon users are not ignored
    </li>
    <li>
        The account being cross-posted is owned by the same person. Third-party

<p>Aethy is a safe haven for creative and unique people and communities to flourish! This server is for people to be able to express themselves by sharing their creations, talk about their interests, or just be themselves in an environment that doesn't allow harassment to flourish. In contrast to other environments online, we also want to be a safe space for marginalized individuals including queer folks, people of color, and women by disallowing hateful speech and ideals.</p>

<p>As advertisers become prevalent in online spaces, many sites limit what type of content is allowed in order to appease them. From banning nudity all the way to banning strange and niche kinks! By contrast, Aethy embraces and loves the human body! We love when adults get kinky and sometimes downright strange with their sexuality! We don't believe in regressive ideologies that limit creative speech and content between consenting adults. With that belief in mind, we made Aethy. The policies were envisioned and sculpted by people who've dealt with hate all their lives, as well as experiencing mental, physical, and sexual abuse (both as minors and as adults). It's extremely important to us that we create a safe space for our community so we've built the site on the principles of inclusion and consent.</p>

<p>Instead of continuing to be squeezed out of spaces because perhaps we're too weird, too queer, or too kinky... we've made our own space! We don't think there's any wrong way to express ourselves as long as we adhere to the principles of consent and inclusion! We no longer want to inhabit spaces where we're beholden to advertisers, puritans and those that wish to spread hate!</p>

<div class=""about__section__title"">FAQ</div>

<div class=""about__section__body"">
<h1>Content Warnings</h1>
<h3>What is a <span title=""Content Warning"" class=""fa fa-warning fa-fw"" /></span> or ""CW?""</h3>

<p><span title=""Content Warning"" class=""fa fa-warning fa-fw"" /></span> or a ""CW"" is short for ""Content Warning"". When a user is making a post, they have the option to click a button that has a <span title=""Content Warning"" class=""fa fa-warning fa-fw"" /></span> symbol. This is used to warn other users about content they might not wish to see (such as sexual or violent content).</p>

<h3>What content needs a <span title=""Content Warning"" class=""fa fa-warning fa-fw"" /></span>?</h3>

<p>Public and Unlisted Posts that contain sexual themes, gore, and depictions/discussions of sensitive topics require warnings. Any media where the intent is to arouse is included in this (even if a censor bar or a blur effect is applied). This also includes images where the subject is posed in a sexual manner, or if a body part is framed in an attempt to be arousing. Light blood doesn't require a <span title=""Content Warning"" class=""fa fa-warning fa-fw"" /></span> but beyond that, a <span title=""Content Warning"" class=""fa fa-warning fa-fw"" /></span> is most likely required. Finally, sensitive topics include politics, religion, spirituality, niche belief systems, abuse (including relationship which would be abusive in reality), current events and other topics that could potentially upset someone.</p>

<p>Just do your best though! No one is gonna get in trouble unless they're intentionally trying to upset other users!</p>

<h3>What happens if I forget to add a <span title=""Content Warning"" class=""fa fa-warning fa-fw"" /></span>?</h3>

<p>The best thing to do is to quickly edit your post and add one. Otherwise, you'll receive a reminder from a staff member reminding you to add one provided the post content isn't deemed to be too upsetting! Staff members will also typically give suggestions as to what tags may be appropriate. However, if the lack of a <span title=""Content Warning"" class=""fa fa-warning fa-fw"" /></span> on a post could be extremely distressing to viewers, the post may be deleted and need to be redrafted from your email. Accounts that ignore staff warnings may also be Limited so the posts don't appear in public timelines and all images will be marked as ""sensitive"". To have the Limited status removed, simply edit your posts to include a <span title=""Content Warning"" class=""fa fa-warning fa-fw"" /></span> and then appeal the Limited status. Punitive action will never be taken, we will simply put measures in place to protect other users from content they may wish to avoid!</p>

<h3>What if my <span title=""Content Warning"" class=""fa fa-warning fa-fw"" /></span>s aren't good enough?</h3>

<p>Try your best! If the <span title=""Content Warning"" class=""fa fa-warning fa-fw"" /></span>s aren't comprehensive enough, the staff's course of action will be similar to the above. As a general rule of thumb, try to avoid simply marking a post as ""NSFW"" or something similar. Ask yourself why it's NSFW and list those reasons in the CW. Also avoid overly broad CWs such as ""Nudity"", ""Age Gap"", ""Dead Dove"", etc. Be specific about the subjects and what content is involved!</p>

<h3>What's an example of a <span title=""Content Warning"" class=""fa fa-warning fa-fw"" /></span>?</h3>

<p>Examples for sexual content are ""Kink"", ""Sex"", ""Sexual Nudity"", ""Boner"", ""Erection"", ""Het"", ""GL"", “BL”, “MLM”, “Anal”, “Blowjob”, “Boner”, “Blood”, “Gore”, “Vore”, “Macro”, ""Age gap"", “Underage”, ""Shota"", ""Loli"", “Minor/Adult”, ""Teen/Adult"", etc.</p>

<p>An example for a heavier topic could include ""Politics"", ""Hate Speech"", ""Harassment"", ""Discourse"", ""Syscourse"", etc.</p>

<p>When it comes to religion, spirituality and niche belief systems and frameworks, some examples are ""Spirituality, ""Religion"", ""Otherkin"", ""Therian"", ""Christian"", ""Jesus"", etc.</p>

<p>Basically, the more specific you can get, the better! But you also don't have to make an essay out of it! However, please avoid using loaded words that can be used synonymously with real abuse as <span title=""Content Warning"" class=""fa fa-warning fa-fw"" /></span>s. <span title=""Content Warning"" class=""fa fa-warning fa-fw"" /></span>s are meant to allow people to avoid content they don't wish to see and should do so without causing distress to others.</p>

<h3>Does simple nudity require a <span title=""Content Warning"" class=""fa fa-warning fa-fw"" /></span>?</h3>

<p>Nope! Content warnings are not required for non-sexual nudity (e.g. images that don't feature close-ups of genitals, boners, or sex acts). Basically, if it's an image you'd find in an art museum or if the intention of the content isn't to arouse, it doesn't need a <span title=""Content Warning"" class=""fa fa-warning fa-fw"" /></span>. This policy doesn't discriminate against age or body type either. If the subject is a real adult and has consented, or if it's a fictional drawing, then nudity is no different than if the subject is clothed! This also means images that contain nudity can be used in profile icons and banners!</p>

<p>You’re still free to use content warnings when they’re not required, however!</p>

<h3>What counts as sexual or erotic?</h3>

<p>Any image where the intent is to arouse or where the subjects featured are engaged in a sexual act. This may even include images that don't feature sexual nudity such as images that contain bodily fluids or where the subject(s) are posed in a sexual nature. It also includes images that attempt to censor the sexual content (e.g. placing a bar over a boner or blurring it). Basically, if it's obvious what's going on, it needs a <span title=""Content Warning"" class=""fa fa-warning fa-fw"" /></span>!</p>

<h3>Can I boost content from another server that doesn't have a <span title=""Content Warning"" class=""fa fa-warning fa-fw"" /></span>?</h3>

<p>Yes! We don't want to discourage interacting with other servers even when their policies relating to <span title=""Content Warning"" class=""fa fa-warning fa-fw"" /></span>s differ from ours. Users are encouraged to proceed with caution when viewing posts from other servers. However, if a post isn't marked as ""sensitive"" when it would be required to have a <span title=""Content Warning"" class=""fa fa-warning fa-fw"" /></span> on Aethy, please report it so we can mark it ourselves!</p>

<h1>Acceptable Content</h1>

<h3>Can I post content I don't own the rights to?</h3>

<p>This isn't legal advice but typically screenshots, cropped comic panels, clips from television, etc. fall under Fair Use in the United States. This also includes fan art, fan fiction, and other such content. Staff members will not typically remove content from mass media properties that we believe to fall under Fair Use. However, if a user uploads full television episodes or movies, copyrighted music, and other such content, it will be removed and the user suspended as it is not Fair Use. Also, when it comes to independent creators, we ask that you do not repost their creations (e.g. artwork, photos, videos, etc.) without the creator's permission. We also ask that you don't include their characters in your creations in a way that could cause duress (e.g. drawing sexual imagery of someone's mascot character without their permission).</p>

<h3>Can I upload works created with AI?</h3>

<p>Yes but it must be disclosed. AI assisted works (such as art where background elements are created by AI) simply require disclosure of the tool used in the post body. However, when posting works created entirely (or nearly entirely) by AI, a <span title=""Content Warning"" class=""fa fa-warning fa-fw"" /></span> must be added indicating that it's AI generated and what tool was used to create it. However, works that were created by directly modifying someone else's copyrighted content may not be posted unless the original content falls under Fair Use. The AI used must also have been trained in a clean room environment that wasn't trained using real human subjects. Especially in the case of pictures featuring underage characters.</p>

<h2>Who, What, Where, Why</h2>

<p>zeroes.ca is a COVID-aware community built on Mastodon and connected to the fediverse. We're hosted on servers in Canada, operated by admins who live in Canada, and open to people from anywhere in the world. We are not a commercial website; we have no financial interest in your data or activity. This is a volunteer-run, voluntary service. We're here for dissemination of science, experiences, information, and ideas; conversation and discussions; questions and answers -- a safe, good faith, and censorship-free space for any and all COVID-related topics. Misinfo, disinfo, and other unlawful, harmful, and/or bad faith content is not permitted.</p>

<h2>Moderation</h2>

<p>Our goal is to provide an environment conducive to community and communication and hostile to anything unlawful, malicious, and/or synonymous with bullying. We reserve the right to remove any accounts, content, or federated servers that are detrimental to this community and the above goal. We realize you're human and we are too, so we'll do our best to be fair yet protective. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to admins/mods.</p>

<h2>Reporting</h2>

<p>When reporting accounts, please include posts that show rule-breaking behaviour (when applicable). Detailed context in the comment will help us fully understand the situation and take appropriate action. This is especially important when the content is in a language nobody on the moderation team speaks. We endeavour to handle all reports within 24 hours. Bear in mind that you are not notified of punitive actions pursuant to any reports you make. Also, not all punitive actions are externally visible.</p>

<p>Please sign up on <a href=""https://climatejustice.social"">climatejustice.social</a> instead.</p>

<p>climatejustice.rocks was created during a time, when a lot of people were joining the Fediverse and quitting Twitter/X. The existing server climatejustice.social couldn&#39;t handle the load anymore.<br>
Now there is no need for separate servers anymore.</p>

<p>Everybody who is on .rocks, please move!</p>

<p>Note: climatejustice.global will remain a separate server, as that one is specifically for groups.</p>

<h3><font size=""6.5"">ABOUT THIS SERVER</font></h3>

<p>This is a Fediverse/Mastodon instance for climate justice activists and everybody who feels they belong to the climatejustice movement and follows our rules and principles as described below.</p>

<h3><font size=""6.5"">WHO WE ARE</font></h3>

<p>&quot;We&quot; is currently basically just Paula (@PaulaToThePeople@climatejustice.social), who owns the server.<br>
It is hosted locally in Vienna, Austria via the Fediverse Foundation.
The server is NOT officially part of the Fediverse Foundation though.<br></p>

<h3><font size=""6.5"">PRINCIPLES</font></h3>

<h3><font size=""4"">We stand for climate justice, which includes justice for all marginalized people as well as other living beings and we stand against discrimination and exploitation.</font></h3>

<p>We are allies to disabled people, queer and lgbtqia* people, BIPoC, women, poor people, kids and future generations as well as other vulnerable groups including animals, plants and all living beings. We might be critical to religion in general, but stand up against antisemitism, islamomisia and other forms of discrimination due to religious background.
We acknowledge our own privileges and work on our own unintentionally discriminatory behaviors. We are all part of an exploitative system and it&#39;s impossible to live within that system without harming anyone. We are aware of that and try to work against it, but we are not all fossil free and vegan and that&#39;s okay. We don&#39;t exclusively post about climate justice, but at least some of our posts should be about climate justice.</p>

<h3><font size=""4"">We consider ourselves on the left side of the political spectrum and stand up against right wing ideologies.</font></h3>

<p>We have different political views, but are all on the left side or at least are left-open, but right-closed centrists. We stand together against capitalism and fascism and even if we disagree on important issues we don&#39;t loose sight of our common goals.</p>

<h3><font size=""4"">We believe the Fediverse should be a place for respectful discourse and we stand against harassment, trolling and spam.</font></h3>

<p>Everybody&#39;s boundaries are to be respected.</p>

<h3><font size=""4"">We stand up for peace and against violence, oppression and authoritarianism.</font></h3>

<p>We are pacifists, but acknowledge that when attacked, people have the right to defend themselves following international law.
We may be critical of states in general, but we never deny any country their statehood.
We condemn violence against innocent people and always show solidarity with victims of violence. We don&#39;t promote violence in protest, but peaceful sabotage against oppressors is not violence.</p>

<h3><font size=""4"">We stand behind the science and against fake-news & propaganda.</font></h3>

<p>We are not all scientists ourselves and experts in every field we post about, but we try not to spread any false information. If possible we provide reliable sources. We don&#39;t spread unverified rumors.</p>

<h3><font size=""6.5"">RULES</font></h3>

<ul>
<li>follow Austrian and EU law</li>
<li>don&#39;t post pornography</li>
</ul>

<h3><font size=""6.5"">GUIDELINES</font></h3>

<p>Try to always:</p>

<ul>
<li>provide media descriptions</li>
<li>use CamelCase in hashtags</li>
<li>not overdo it with emojis</li>
<li>use content warnings when appropriate</li>
<li>hide sensitive media</li>
<li>avoid links to privacy violating sites if possible</li>
</ul>

<h3><font size=""6.5"">DISCLAIMER</font></h3>

<p>Principles, rules and guidelines may change at any time and sanctions may be applied according to rules that have not been written yet at that time, but of course never without justification. Appeal is always possible.</p>

<h3><font size=""6.5"">MODERATION POLICIES</font></h3>

<p>These are just examples for further clarification. Our principles, rules and guidelines above are what you have to stick to.</p>

<p>What will get you banned immediately:</p>

<ul>
<li>open discrimination</li>
<li>right wing ideologies</li>
<li>harassment, trolling, spam and porn</li>
<li>calls for violence</li>
<li>sympathy for oppression</li>
<li>pro-authoritarianism</li>
<li>spreading of anti-science stances, fake news or propaganda</li>
<li>breaking the law drastically or repeatedly</li>
</ul>

<p>When will we ask you to leave our instance:</p>

<ul>
<li>when you don&#39;t align with our principles</li>
<li>when you follow our rules, but post almost nothing related to climate justice</li>
<li>when you appear more critical of other leftists than the people on the right</li>
<li>when we recorded multiple strikes against you</li>
<li>when you show a pattern of failing to condemn violence or show unreflected solidarity with a violent, oppressive or authoritarian group of people</li>
<li>when you do things that break Austrian law, but are okay somewhere else</li>
<li>when even after multiple hints you completely disregard our guidelines</li>
</ul>

<p>What will get your post deleted and a strike recorded against you:</p>

<ul>
<li>likely unintentional discriminatory behavior or wording</li>
<li>likely unintentional behavior that doesn&#39;t respect someone else&#39;s bondaries</li>
<li>likely unintentionally posting something that could lead to violence</li>
<li>likely unintentional spreading of false or unverified information</li>
<li>when you post something that we fear might get us in trouble with the law</li>
</ul>

<p>When will we ask you to edit your post and/or consider something for the future:</p>

<ul>
<li>clearly unintentional inconsiderate or unreflective behavior or wording</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mastodon for Professionals and Brands</h2>

<p>Managed Hosting tailored for developers, entrepreneurs, and businesses. Benefit from our industry-leading support and focus on your market without the hassles of administration or content moderation.</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>

<p>We rigorously adhere to the <a href=""https://joinmastodon.org/covenant"">Mastodon Server Covenant</a>. The admin team actively addresses reports, offering guidance and, if necessary, immediate intervention in cases of abuse.</p>

<h2>English Language Only</h2>

<p>Effective from September 2023, accounts with non-English information in their profiles will be suspended. This measure addresses the surge of fake accounts promoting SPAM in other languages. Our admin team is proficient in English moderation, making it the exclusive language for our platform.</p>

<h2>Server Blocking</h2>

<p>We block instances promoting extreme political views (both far-right and far-left) due to their potential for abusive tactics and hate speech promotion. Additionally, instances with incompatible rules or technical issues that affect our server&#39;s functionality are subject to blocking. This includes, but is not limited to, kink, porn, anti-crypto, and anti-capitalist themed servers.</p>

<h2>SPAM</h2>

<p>Strictly prohibited. Accounts suspected of SPAM will be banned immediately. Maintaining the server&#39;s reputation is paramount. We emphasize personal interactions and robust moderation to prevent SPAM, which is detrimental to our and your reputation. Brand awareness works on Mastodon through one on one interactions and genuine content, not SPAM advertising.</p>

<h2>Prohibition of Gambling and Betting Activities</h2>

<p>We enforce a strict ban on all forms of gambling, gaming for money, betting, or related activities. This encompasses sharing links to gambling sites, discussing or promoting betting strategies, organizing betting pools, and any advertisements or sponsorships related to gambling. Violations may lead to warnings or bans, depending on the severity.</p>

<h2>New Rule: Regulation of SPAM Content for Brands and Professionals</h2>

<p>Link posting SPAM bots will not be tolerated. It doesn&#39;t work here. It harms the server. Build your own server or add ActivityPub to your website if you want this kind of engagement. This is an exploit pure and simple and we do not tolerate it.</p>

<h3>Engagement and Authenticity</h3>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Purposeful Engagement:</strong> Content must engage the Mastodon community or use the ActivityPub protocol. Purely promotional content without meaningful interaction is SPAM.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Authenticity and Relevance:</strong> Posts should be authentic, relevant, and add value. Repetitive, irrelevant, or solely promotional content is considered SPAM.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Community Standards:</strong> Brands and professionals should foster community by participating in discussions, responding to feedback, and sharing content that reflects the interests and values of the Mastodon community.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Closed Enrollment Policy:</strong> To maintain quality and community engagement, open enrollment is closed. New members are selectively admitted based on alignment with community values and standards.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Non-compliance may lead to content removal, warnings, or account suspension. These rules aim to balance professional and brand contributions with the ethos of Mastodon and ActivityPub.</p>

<h1>📜 Rules</h1>

<p>We want everyone on this instance to feel comfortable expressing themselves. That being said there are limits. We have zero tolerance for any blatant homophobia / transphobia / trolling / hating and in general just people that are here to ruin the mood. We are lgbt+ run and supportive. </p>

<p>Registering an account on this instance means you are at least 16 years old. Additionally you agree that browsing the timelines from this instance might expose you to not-safe-for-work and other unwanted material. This is due to the nature of the fediverse. You agree to report these posts so our moderator team can take actions against the violating instance or user.</p>

<p>If you are under the age of 18 years old we highly recommend making use of filters <a href=""https://bark.lgbt/filters"">https://bark.lgbt/filters</a> to filter out commonly used hashtags in NSFW, i.e. #nsfw</p>

<p>If your account is identified as being younger than 18 years old and you are seen posting NSFW content your account will be suspended. This falls under illegal content.</p>

<p>We accept the posting of NSFW content however to protect other instances feeds we require not safe for work (NFSW) content to be tagged appropriately. Use both a content warning (CW) and blur media if any media is attached. If this is violated your post may be removed and repeated violation of this rule will result in a ban.</p>

<p>Profile pictures and profile headers MUST be PG-13 and cannot be NSFW / explicit. If your profile is found to violate this rule our moderators will remove your profile picture and/or header. You are then free to upload a alternative that does adhere to this rule.</p>

<p>Zoophillia is not accepted on this instance, nor any mention of it.</p>

<p>This is not a exhaustive list of rules and by registering to this instance you agree that we can add, remove or modify rules without prior notice. If you are in breach of one of our rules our moderator team will contact you and attempt to resolve the situation. If you are uncooperative we may choose to suspend your account on this instance.</p>

<h1>🐺 Acceptable content</h1>

<p>While we are (canine) furry focused everyone is welcome to join in the howl! No matter your species. Non-furry content is allowed as well, do keep in mind to CW your posts if they include anything you don&#39;t want to see in public, Especially NSFW! </p>

<p>See something? Say something! Use the report feature to report posts and our team will review them on a case-by-case basis. All reports will be handled fairly for all parties involved.</p>

<h1>💬 Languages</h1>

<p>While we are a primary English speaking instance we do offer translations for the following languages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Czech</li>
<li>Dutch</li>
<li>French</li>
<li>German</li>
<li>Italian</li>
<li>Spanish</li>
</ul>

<p>When you create a post you can specify which language you are typing your post in. Choosing one of the above languages will offer users of this instance a &#39;translate&#39; button to automatically translate your posts content into English</p>

<h1>📢 Fediblock policy</h1>

<p>Our team regularly monitors the #fediblock hashtag and acts accordingly. Additionally if we identify a malicious instance our team will announce this to #fediblock. </p>

<p>We obscure the names of all instances that are suspended/silenced. If you suspect we have blocked your instance and you want to appeal then please contact our team via email [admin@bark.lgbt]</p>

<h2>Q. ジャンルに指定はありますか？</h2>

<p>ありません。フリージャンルです。漫画／小説／同性愛／絵に限らず、立体作品やゲームなどもご自由にどうぞ。</p>

<h2>Q. 今現在作品を作っていませんが登録可能ですか？</h2>

<p>作者も読者も、同人に興味さえあればどなたでも登録できます（高校生以上）。全く作品を作っていない人もいます。なんなら同人に興味がなくても、ここがそういうサーバーであることに理解がある限り登録できます。</p>

<h2>Q. エロの話はできますか？</h2>

<p>できます。なぜなら管理人自身も、成人向け同人誌・商業作品を描いているからです。</p>

<h2>Q. 同人の話以外はできますか？</h2>

<p>できます。おはようからおやすみ、仕事の愚痴、子育てなど、『創作作家・読者が日常的に使えるような<strong>汎用サーバー</strong>』が目指すスタイルです。なんなら同人の話ゼロでも構いません。</p>

<h2>Q. 逆に投稿してはいけないものはありますか？</h2>

<p>AIイラスト、実写エロ、ロリエロ、性犯罪などはダメです。（実写はコミケのコスプレ程度なら可能）<br>
エロ画像は商業誌レベルの修正をお願いしております。他のサイトより厳しいですがご了承ください。<br>
あと無断転載もある程度は黙認してますが、節度を越えたものは著作者からの連絡がなくても削除します。</p>

<h2>Q. 女性向け作家が多いと聞きましたが男性向け作家は登録できますか？</h2>

<p>管理者が男性成人向け作家です。<del>どうしてこうなった</del><br>
ここにいる人たちなら「自分の好き嫌い」と「社会に存在すべきでない」を分別できると信じています。苦手なジャンルはミュート・ブロックしてね。</p>

<h2>Q. 規制が厳しいって聞いたけど？</h2>

<p>ここは<strong>ちょっとした下ネタですら</strong>「CW」といって警告文をつけて隠す必要があります。<br>
<strong>18禁・15禁に限らずほんのちょっとえっちなだけの画像ですら</strong>「NSFW」といって閲覧注意フラグをつけて隠す必要があります。<br>
逆に言うと、きちんとルールを守れば大体なんでも投稿できます。<a href=""https://github.com/kmycode/mastodon/wiki/%E3%82%BB%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B7%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%83%96%E3%81%AA%E8%A1%A8%E7%8F%BE%E3%81%AE%E3%82%AC%E3%82%A4%E3%83%89%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3"">センシティブな表現のガイドライン</a></p>

<h2>Q. ルールに違反したらすぐ凍結されるの？</h2>

<p>スパム・荒らし・特に悪質なケースなど以外で凍結例はありません。違反時には「警告」メールがいきますので、内容を確認してください。<br>
一番多いのは、エロをCWやNSFWで隠し忘れるケースです。誰でもうっかりミスとしてありえるもので、あなたがよく交流しているそのアカウントも過去に警告メールを受け取っているかもしれません。最低でもTwitterほど厳しくはないのでそこはご安心ください。</p>

<h2>Q. ここで自分の作品の宣伝などできますか？</h2>

<p>１人あたり１日２回までです。もっとも、人が少ないので宣伝してもあまり拡散されません。拡散力を求めるならMisskeyのほうがいいです。ここはみんながまったり会話する場所です。</p>

<h2>Q. Mastodonは検索機能が弱いと聞いたけど？</h2>

<p>kmyblueは特別な処理を追加しているため、他のMastodonより検索がつよつよです。ただ、それでもMisskeyにはかないません。</p>

<h2>Q. 政治の話は禁止ですか？</h2>

<p>特定人物・団体を批判する文脈で「ゴミ」「バカ」という言葉を使ったら投稿削除します。全面禁止ではありませんが、他のSNSよりかなり厳しいです。</p>

</ul>

<p>詳しいルールはもっと下の細則を見てください。細則が非常に長い文章になったのは、「何をやったら凍結するかわからない」という状況をできるだけ作りたくないためです。他のサービスでトラブルを経験したような人でなければ基本的には大丈夫かもしれませんが、時間のある時に読んでいただけると嬉しいです。</p>

<h2>kmyblueでえっちな画像を投稿する時</h2>

<h1>スマホアプリはありますか？</h1>

<p>kmyblueには独自機能があるため、通常のmastodonクライアントアプリでは機能をフルに利用できません。一番いいのはブラウザかPWAですが、iOSのPWAはスリープ時にストリーミングが切れる問題があります。</p>

<p>ネイティブアプリを使用する場合、Fedibird互換絵文字リアクションに対応したアプリをおすすめします。
もちろんその他の汎用mastodonアプリでも、kmyblueをお使いになれます。</p>

<h2>おすすめスマホアプリ</h2>

502,6409e4cc5b6b2d471725a2ca,ai.wiki,False,6491,"<p>Welcome to AI.Wiki, the decentralized artificial intelligence censorship-proof social media network that is revolutionizing the way we communicate online. Built For Small Business, By Small Business! Bring your friends too!</p>

<p>AI.Wiki is a decentralized social media platform that provides several benefits to businesses. Here are some of the key advantages:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Control: Unlike centralized social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, Mastodon gives businesses more control over their content and how it&#39;s shared. Mastodon users can create their own servers or join existing ones, and they have complete control over their data.</p></li>
<li><p>Privacy: AI.Wiki is designed with privacy in mind. Users can control who sees their content and messages, and there are no third-party advertisers tracking their activity. This can be particularly beneficial for businesses that deal with sensitive or confidential information.</p></li>
<li><p>Niche Communities: AI.Wiki allows businesses to connect with niche communities that may not be easily accessible on traditional social media platforms. By joining a relevant Mastodon server, businesses can engage with potential customers who share their interests.</p></li>
<li><p>No Algorithms: Unlike traditional social media platforms, AI.Wiki doesn&#39;t use algorithms to determine what content users see. This means that businesses have a better chance of their content being seen by their followers.</p></li>
<li><p>Cost-Effective: AI.Wiki is a cost-effective social media platform, especially for small businesses that may not have the resources to invest in traditional social media advertising. Businesses can create an AI.Wiki account for FREE and use it to connect with potential customers and friends.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Overall, Ai.Wiki&#39;s decentralized structure provides businesses with more control, privacy, and opportunities to connect with niche communities. It&#39;s also a cost-effective alternative to traditional social media advertising.</p>

<p>AI.Wiki server accepts ALL business postings. It is important to note that users have the option to block individual users or entire instances if they do not want to see certain content. This is a personal choice and may vary from user to user. Ultimately, it&#39;s up to each user to decide what content they want to see on their timeline and take appropriate action to manage it. PLEASE, if you do not want to see business offers, instead of reporting anyone from AI.Wiki server, PLEASE block the user or the whole server/instance, Thank you</p>

<p>AI.Wiki is a decentralized social media platform, which means that there is no central authority governing what content can or cannot be posted. Each Mastodon server is run by an individual or organization who sets their own rules for what is allowed on their server. Many Mastodon servers are open to accepting business postings because they recognize the value of having businesses as part of their community. Businesses can bring in new users, provide interesting content, and even help support the server financially through donations or paid accounts.</p>

<p>At AI.Wiki, we believe in the power of technology to connect people, ideas, and knowledge across the world. We also recognize the importance of preserving free speech and open discourse, which is why we have created a platform that is censorship-proof and resistant to outside influence.</p>

<p>Our platform is built on Mastodon, a decentralized social network that allows users to communicate and share content without fear of censorship or surveillance. This means that AI.Wiki users have the freedom to express themselves in any way they choose, without worrying about their content being blocked or deleted.</p>

<p>But what really sets AI.Wiki apart is our use of artificial intelligence. Our platform is designed to learn from user behavior and adapt to their preferences, making it easier than ever to find the content that matters most to you. Whether you&#39;re looking for the latest news, trending topics, or informative articles, AI.Wiki is the place to be.</p>

<p>We believe that AI.Wiki is more than just a social media network. It&#39;s a community of like-minded individuals who are committed to sharing ideas, knowledge, and information in a safe and secure environment. We invite you to join us and be a part of this exciting new chapter in the evolution of social media.</p>

<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>

<p>At Newsmast, there have to be rules, so that everyone feels safe and respected. We want to encourage a diversity of voices, which means allowing everyone to feel welcome without enduring hate speech or harassment of any kind.</p>

<p>Please read our <a href=""https://www.newsmastfoundation.org/community-guidelines/"">community guidelines</a> to learn more about what we stand for. </p>

<p>We plan to evolve these guidelines as time goes on in line with the development of Newsmast. Those who repeatedly fail to abide by them will be removed from the platform. Accounts posting certain types of offensive or illegal content will be removed immediately.</p>

<p>The community guidelines above also relate to direct messages. </p>

<p><strong>Reporting and moderation</strong></p>

<p>At Newsmast, we aim to abolish harassment, abuse and misinformation. If you find content that’s in breach of these guidelines, please report it by clicking on the three dots at the bottom right corner of the post and selecting report. Provide details of why you are reporting the post, then click confirm and report. Or you can email us at <a href=""mailto:support@newsmast.org"">support@newsmast.org</a>. </p>

<p>Following the report, there are several measures that we can take:</p>

<p>●  Removing a post or comment: After we’ve done this, we’ll notify the account owner and inform them of the violation. They’re entitled to dispute the removal if they believe we got it wrong. </p>

<p>●  Direct messages: If a direct message breaches our policies, we can temporarily or permanently suspend an account. Note that we are unable to monitor contents of DMs unless you report a message to us. </p>

<p>●  Account suspension: Anyone who repeatedly violates our policies can be temporarily or permanently suspended. Being permanently suspended will forbid account owners from creating new accounts. The account holder can appeal this if they think we got it wrong. </p>

<p>Rest assured, our team will examine your complaint promptly.</p>

<h3>ルール</h3> 

<p> 

  違反者には、アカウントの停止等の措置を取らせていただく場合がございます。<br> 

  措置に不服がある場合には、メールにてお問い合わせください。 

</p> 

<ol style=""margin: 0 2em 2em 2em;""> 

  <li style=""margin: 0;"">法律は守ってください</li> 

  <li style=""margin: 0;"">CWやNSFWはちゃんと使ってください</li> 

  <li style=""margin: 0;"">他人に迷惑をかけたり、不快にするような行為は禁止です</li> 

  <li style=""margin: 0;"">みんな仲良く</li> 

</ol> 

<h4>1. 法律は守ってください</h4> 

<p>犯罪に加担していそうだったり、日本法に抵触するようなトゥートは禁止です。最悪警察や裁判所の要請に応じてログを開示することになります。</p> 

<h4>2. CWやNSFWはちゃんと使ってください</h4> 

<p> 

  誰かが不快になりそうだと思った文章を投稿したい時にはContent Warning(CW)を、画像にはNot Safe For Work(NSFW)タグを付けてください。警告文には、見たくない人が投稿の内容を表示しないでスルーできるような説明を書いてください(例: エロ, グロ, 長文, Undertaleネタバレ)。たとえ付けていても日本法に抵触するような画像を投稿する行為は禁止です。<br> 

  とはいえ、正直なところ1人でも傷つく可能性がある投稿には全てCWを付けろと言ってもキリが無くなってしまいます。特にローカルTLや連合TLはたくさんの人の発言がほぼフィルタリングされずに流れてくるタイムラインです。それらのタイムラインを覗くときには不愉快な投稿が目に見えてしまう可能性があると言うことをある程度割り切ってください。 

</p> 

<h4>3. 他人に迷惑をかけたり、不快にするような行為は禁止です</h4> 

<p>連投やフォロ爆などの過度に迷惑がかかる投稿は禁止です。スパムにしか見えないような宣伝とかもやめてね。</p> 

<h4>4. みんな仲良く</h4> 

<p> 

  ブロックとかミュートとかあるからね、絶対に仲良くできなさそうな人がいたら突っかかる前に距離を取ろうね。ブロックしました報告とかもトラブルの元になるだけだからやめようね。<br> 

  人に自分ルールを押し付けて不快にさせる行為も禁止です。あなたのルールはここのルールではありません。ネタだとしても不快にさせる時点でよくありません。 

</p> 

<p><hr style=""margin: 2em 0;""> </p>

<h3>Bot運用ルール</h3> 

<p> 

  ある程度プログラムが書ける人の中には、API経由で投稿ができるWebサービスを見つけたら何かボットを作ってみたくなる人も多いことかと思いますが、そういった方々にお願いがあります。 

</p> 

<p> 

  Mastodonの根幹となる要素に「連合」というものがあります。これは、リモートフォローをすることによって他のインスタンスのアカウントとも繋がることが出来るという、従来主流であったSNSには存在しなかった要素です。 

</p> 

<p> 

  Mastodonには連合の仕組みがあり、他のインスタンスからリモートフォローを受けることができるため、何百、何千とあるインスタンスのうち、いずれか一つのインスタンスにBotアカウントを設置していれば、使いたい人はそれをリモートフォローしに行くことができます。 

</p> 

<p> 

  ですから、わざわざ他のインスタンスにも設置したBotをわざわざ Pawooにも設置するようなことは絶対にしないでください。そのようなBotに対してはサイレンス処理を行うことがあります。 

</p> 

<p> 

  また、ローカルタイムラインや連合タイムラインは、日常的に閲覧する用途に向いていないタイムラインではありますが、交流したい人を探す用途に用いられていることは確かですので、なるべく自動投稿の類が表示されることを避けたいと思っています。そこで Pawoo にBotを設置しようと考えている方々には、最低限以下の条件を守って頂きたいと思います: 

</p> 

<ul> 

  <li>Publicな投稿をしないこと(Unlisted, Private, Directを使ってください)</li> 

  <li>能動的に他のアカウントをフォローしに行かないこと</li> 

  <li>フォローしていない人のトゥートを自動でお気に入り登録したり、リプライを飛ばしたりしないこと</li> 

</ul> 

<p> 

  意図としては、Twitterの<a href=""https://help.twitter.com/ja/rules-and-policies/twitter-automation"">自動化ルール</a>と同じような感じです。許可なくスパムのような挙動をしていると判断したbotはサイレンス、アカウント停止などの措置を取らせて頂きます。 

</p> 

<p><hr style=""margin: 2em 0;""> </p>

<p>お問い合わせは，<a href=""mailto:pawoo-support@sujitech.com"">メール</a>でお願いします．</p>
