How did Hamas - a weak little extremist terrorist group - get around Israel's security?

Please donate if you can and share this campaign because A’nee's life mattered. When we say Black Trans Lives Matter, this is the moment to stand in solidarity with us as we mourn the loss of our sister.</p><p>The funds raised will be used to support A’nee's family during this difficult time, including covering the costs of her burial. Her family is devastated by her sudden death, but we at DC Safe Haven are committed to standing up and fighting back when trans lives are under attack. </p><p>For the gofundme to donate, see here: <a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/f/laying-anee-to-rest"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"" translate=""no"" target=""_blank""><span class=""invisible"">https://www.</span><span class=""ellipsis"">gofundme.com/f/laying-anee-to-</span><span class=""invisible"">rest</span></a></p><p>Donate if you can, boost if you can't.</p><p><a href=""https://blackqueer.life/tags/MutualAid"" class=""mention hashtag"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">#<span>MutualAid</span></a></p>",2023-10-26 01:48:48+00:00,[],"[{'name': 'mutualaid', 'url': 'https://genomic.social/tags/mutualaid'}]",0,0
