<h1>Provo.lol</h1>

<p>Provo.lol is a tiny server running Mastodon. Our small community values knowledge-sharing, creativity, empathy, and socialism. This guide will help people who want to join provo.lol to get started. </p>

<h2>What is Mastodon?</h2>

<p>Mastodon is a micro-blogging platform based on the principles of free, open source software and distributed networking. If you are familiar with Twitter, you already know what micro-blogging is: the sharing of short online messages with a public community. Mastodon is free and open source, which means that everyone can download the software free of charge, and contribute to its development. Mastodon’s network is distributed, which means that the messages sent across the network are not all stored on a single computer, but on as many computers as there are Mastodon servers. </p>

<p>You can see provo.lol as a tiny star in a vast network of Mastodon servers, a network that’s also known as the Fediverse (as in, federated + universe). Everyone who is part of provo.lol can connect with hundreds of thousands of microbloggers across the world!</p>

<h2>Signing up</h2>

<p>Signing up to a Mastodon server is easy. All you need is a username, an e-mail address and a password for your account. At provo.lol we’re not requiring anyone to give their real name. You could do so, but a nickname or alias is perfectly fine too. But do make sure you choose a good password. (For a fun way to generate strong passwords, try the <a href=""https://www.eff.org/dice"">diceware method</a> at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.)</p>

<p>For extra security, it is possible to set up two-factor authentication later. Provo.lol uses Google Authenticator for this, an app you can download on your phone for free. We strongly recommend setting up two-factor authentication, as it allows us to verify it’s really you. Each time you log in, we can then check both your password and a unique code generated on your phone. In this way, someone who got hold of your password still would not be able to log in under your name. This keeps your account super safe.</p>

<p>If you want to sign-up to provo.lol, you will have to request an invitation, or wait until one of our community invites you.</p>

<h2>Community culture</h2>

<p>We’re a friendly community at provo.lol, and we hope you will make new friends on the Fediverse (recall, the big network of all Mastodon users). Please make sure to follow our Server Rules, which for example prohibit making racist or transphobic remarks, or inciting people to commit violence. Provo.lol will defederate from any servers that have a track-record of condoning fascists, racists, sexists, TERFs, or ableists.</p>

<p>If you see that any message or media broadcast by our server is inappropriate or offensive, or see that we amplify messages from a problematic server, please report it to <a href=""http://provo.lol/@mar"">@mar</a>, our administrator.</p>

<h2>Development</h2>

<p>This instance is still under development, though it is currently functioning smoothly. Recently we&#39;ve upgraded to Mastodon 4. We&#39;ve added external physical storage (1TB SSD) for user file hosting and cache. We&#39;re trying to run this instance wholly locally, without dependence on cloud storage. We have daily off-site backups of our database. </p>

<p>Still to do: better documentation, and (ideally) a move to solar power </p>

<p>Created out of the demise of Mastodon.lol, and meant as an invite-only place for friends, family, and trusted others.</p>

<h2>Why Calamity.world?</h2>

<p>Let&#39;s face it, the world is kind of a mess at the best of times. But that&#39;s okay, because we can learn to live within the chaos of daily life, and find joy and fun in our own little ways. Calamity.world exists because no matter how crazy things get, we know that deep down, it&#39;s going to be fine.</p>

<h2>Mastodon Server Covenant</h2>

<p>This server agrees to follow the principles of the <a href=""https://joinmastodon.org/covenant"">Mastodon Server Covenant</a>. This means we adhere to the following rules and statements:</p>

<h4>1. Active moderation against racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia</h4>

<p>This server supports the 2SLGBTQIA+ community, feminists, activists, tinkerers, philosophers, and everyone in between. Fascists, Nazis, MAGAts, TERFs, and conspiracy-theorists are not welcome, and will be defederated.</p>

<h4>2. Daily backups</h4>

<p>This server, its configuration, database, and all uploaded media, is backed up daily both on-premises, and to AWS Cloud Storage (S3).</p>

<h4>3. At least one other person with emergency access to the server infrastructure</h4>

<p>This server is owned and operated by <a href=""https://calamity.world/@t3rminus"">@t3rminus</a>. Additionally <a href=""https://calamity.world/@loginerror"">@loginerror</a> has emergency access to moderation tools, as well as the entire hosting platform and all related network services (including backups) remotely, and, if necessary, physically.</p>

<h4>4. Commitment to give users at least 3 months of advance warning in case of shutting down.</h4>

<p>If it ever becomes necessary to take this server offline, calamity.world pledges to provide 3 months of warning to allow users to backup their data, and migrate it to another server, if desired.</p>

<h2>Trending Posts, Links, and Hashtags Policy</h2>

<p>Trending content is manually reviewed, and will be featured subject to the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>They don&#39;t break any of the server rules.</li>
<li>They are written in, or are about topics in English. The server moderation is multilingual, but may lack regional context to make informed decisions about topics in other languages or from other countries.</li>
<li>They are primarily safe-for-work. Unfortunately some innocuous-seeming hashtags may lead to a considerable amount of not-safe-for-work content, and we cannot guarantee all included content will be posted with appropriate content warnings. We stand by our moderators&#39; judgment on what constitutes &quot;primarily safe-for-work&quot;.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Law Enforcement</h2>

<p>This server is located and operated in Canada, and is subject to relevant laws and law-enforcement actions. While we take measures to protect user data and our users&#39; right to privacy, we will cooperate with copyright holders and law enforcement should it ever become necessary.</p>

<h2>Land Acknowledgement</h2>

<p>We respectfully acknowledge that this server and its staff live and operate on the traditional and unceded territories of the Halkomelem speaking peoples, including the Qayqayt Nation, as well as the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish), and səlilwətaɬ (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations. We pledge to continue to recognize, support, and protect the heritage and history of these peoples that had been suppressed through the horrific acts of colonialism.</p>

<p>
    This instance exists first to give my buddies that listen to my podcast <a href=""https://skyhopperspodcast.libsyn.com/"">The Skyhoppers Podcast</a> place to make their home in the Fediverse. Some patrons had made comments about not quite understanding how Mastodon works, so I took it upon myself to create a space for them and to be their guiding hand through the Fediverse (even though I'm kind of a n00b myself). I'm just starting out on my admin journey, so I'm very open to feedback/helpful tips!
</p>

<p>
    This isn't just an instance for my podcast, though. I've been a huge fan of Star Wars all my life and after I left the internet at large at some point in the last few years, I was really missing a place to talk/post about it and discuss it with other like-minded people. So we'll call that reason Nummer zwei that this instance exists: for Star Wars fans! Hopefully the URL is ambiguous enough to maybe drag in a few stragglers from out there amongst the stars.
</p>

<p>
    Once the podcast <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/theskyhopperspodcast"">Patreon</a> gets started back up (I've had it paused while we've been on break, so our coffers are a little light), I'll be using money from there that doesn't go into hosting the show to host this instance. We had a website for a while, but wouldn't you know that having a website requires a lot of unfun work that I never wanted to do. So hopefully this sticks a little better :)
</p>

<p>
    The rules basically come down to ""don't be a dick."" I'm not going to tolerate hate of any kind here, and you'll get booted right quick if you start talking shit like that. There's a little more detail in the Rules section below if needed. If you enjoy your time spent here, take a second to consider subbing to our Patreon and supporting my efforts that way. Otherwise, just hang out, be cool, and have fun!

I've copied the Code of Conduct that I used there for this server to give you a sense for what kind of place I helped create on the internet.</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>

<ul>
  <li>No advertising or excessive promotion.</li>
  <li>No bots, unless they're cute, funny, or useful. Bots should avoid posting to the public timeline.</li>
  <li>No pornography.</li>
  <li>No gore or graphic violence.</li>
  <li>Content that is borderline NSFW or could be construed as NSFW at a glance should be put behind a CW (Content Warning).</li>
  <li>No racism.</li>
  <li>No sexism.</li>
  <li>No discrimination based on gender, sexual minority, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or national origin.</li>
  <li>No xenophobia, nationalism, casteism, or fascism; no sympathizing with or advocating for these things.</li>
  <li>No sexual depictions of children.</li>
  <li>No holocaust denialism, no Nazi symbolism, no promotion of National Socialism.</li>
  <li>No stalking or harassment. In general, if someone asks you to stop interacting with them, then stop.</li>
  <li>Stalking, harassment, hate speech, or doxing that is posted to other instances or on other social media platforms is still grounds for having your account terminated here.</li>
  <li>No posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information (""doxing"").</li>
  <li>No unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
  <li>No public or private oppressive language or actions.</li>
  <li>No promotion of conspiracy theories (eg anti-vax, anti-mask, anti-COVID).</li>
  <li>No unsolicited advice to strangers.</li>
  <li>No advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.</li>
  <li>No other unethical conduct.</li>
  <li>No scraping content from web interface or API.</li>
</ul>

<p>To <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance"">protect the free speech of users belonging to marginalized groups</a>, this instance does not federate with overtly fascist instances. Additionally, we will refuse to federate with instances that themselves choose to federate with fascist instances.</p>

<h2>Handling harassment</h2>

<p>If you are being harassed, please report the user using the ""…"" button and then ""Report."" For urgent concerns, please DM Ash.</p>

<p>If you engage in harassing behavior, the moderator may take any action they deem appropriate, such as a warning or an expulsion.</p>

<p>The above rules may change at any time, and you may be banned at any time based on the moderators' judgment.</p>

<h2>Privacy policy</h2>

<p>What will we do with your data? Nothing. How will you be influenced by advertisers? You won't. How will we aggregate your data in order to improve your service… none of that.</p>

<p>We will never share your data with anyone else, except in the case of valid legal requests if it comes to that. (Hopefully it won't come to that!) Similarly, users and third parties are forbidden from scraping content from the instance's web interface or API; you are required to respect <code>robots.txt</code> files.</p>

<p>More privacy measures on mastodon.technology:</p>

<ul>
  <li>HTTPS is used everywhere thanks to Let's Encrypt.</li>
  <li>No ads or trackers.</li>
  <li>Links are direct URLs rather than tracking redirects.</li>
  <li>Understand though that this instance is run by Ash, and (as is the case with all Mastodon servers) he potentially have access to your data, including DMs. The back-end is also not encrypted. If this is not okay with you, this might not be the instance for you.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, for truly private data sent between two people, Mastodon offers no E2E encryption. So use Signal for the things you really want to be private.</p>

<p>This instance is invite-only for tech-professionals, coders, hackers, open-source enthusiasts and alike.</p>

<p>We like to build a curated community of nice people that love to nerd out about tech stuff or just need a safe home or a fresh start. But everyone is welcome as long as they follow the rules.</p>

<p>We deeply believe in life, respect, peace, human- and digital rights. We also talk about gaming, music, hobbies, pets and LGTBQIA+ stuff.</p>

<h2>Bums... what?</h2>

<p>&quot;Bums&quot; is German colloquial speech. It&#39;s literal meaning is something like &quot;loud bang&quot; or &quot;loud pop&quot;. It&#39;s often used by younger people to devalue things, so &quot;bumscode&quot; means something along the lines of &quot;shitcode&quot; or &quot;crapcode&quot;. Think of &quot;bums&quot; like the &quot;f&quot; in &quot;wtf&quot;.</p>

<p>The origin of &quot;bumscode&quot; is not 100% clear, but a group of coders at the company <a href=""https://bumscode.com/@kris"">kris</a> is working at, has been using it consistently in code reviews and meetings to refer to bad or not working code. So it&#39;s kind of an in-joke.</p>

637b2fd3d94dca7f11e7b5a1,dctr.uk,False,5,"<h1>Why Mastodon?</h1>

<p>Social media is no longer optional for the doctor - academically active or not. From promoting local causes important to you and your patients, to discussing important research. You will need social media.</p>

<p>To date, Twitter has been the forum used for this. However, it has always been less than ideal and increasingly so is entirely unsuitable. We are concerned by developments at Twitter, and by its impact on the ability of it&#39;s users to continue to engage the wider community in a safe way.</p>

<p>Our server will ensure that it&#39;s users are verified personally, meaning you can trust who the person says they are.</p>

<p>We intend this instance to provide a premium service to it&#39;s users in comparison to others instances. Limiting new joiners will allow us to scale our resources appropriately.</p>

<p>You can have a twitter account, and any number of mastodon accounts. Posting on all of them simultaneously or directing content to the appropriate account. I&#39;ve deleted my twitter account. But I don&#39;t expect that will be everyones reaction to recent events.</p>

<h2>Why Doctors only?</h2>

<p>We have interest in all healthcare professionals, however, as this is a emerging social network we had to limit applications so that we can provide the high level of attention to detail that our users deserve.</p>

<p>The federation that Mastodon allows means that those who can not join yet, can communicate with those who have. And that in time they can migrate their accounts over to us benefiting from out service too.</p>

<h2>Wont this increase my risk litigation or get me in trouble with the GMC?</h2>

<p>Not necessarily, we do not advocate that you share information on Mastodon you wouldn&#39;t on any other social network. In fact, we find that people are most drawn into inappropraite behaviour by interaction with users, often trolls. This is something we hope to avoid on this curated and moderated network.</p>

<h2>Can I still speak my mind?</h2>

<p>Yes, of course. We do not intend to stiffle anyones free speech and ability to speak their mind. And, we will allow users to openly have accounts on multiple servers that are federated (many others instances will not allow this). This will allow users to pick the appropriate forum for their opinions personal, professional or other.</p>

<h1>Verification Process</h1>

<p>Each verification for the time being is being conducted personally. We do plan to open the community more widely, although do not want the quality of verification to be lowered. For the time being, we are personally reaching out to members of the community we think would be a good fit for this burgeoning community.</p>

<p>Think you&#39;re a good fit? Or have someone else in mind? Please contact us.</p>

<p>We may ask for proof you are who you say you are, for example, contact via an NHS.net account and your GMC number. Are you highly active on another platform? Please let us know so we can priortise your sign-up.</p>

<p>Usernames should be formatted @firstname_lastname. You&#39;re encouraged to add your GMC number as metadata and your speciality.</p>

<h1>Pricing</h1>

<p>Access to the instance is intended to be open and free going forwards with the only limitation being blocking problem instances assocaited with trolling or other cyber harm.</p>

<p>Verification and usage is free for the time being and will be for as long as possible. Federation on Mastodon means you are never locked to our instance and free movement is possible keeping your followers and data.</p>

<p>We're a small  general purpose server just looking for a quiet life.</p>

<p>Most of us here are friends who have been here for years and at present we're not open to taking on new users. </p>

<h1>Basic rules</h1>

<p>Content we do not allow that will lead to limiting of accounts or suspension includes but is not limited to:</p>

<ul><li>Harassment, block evasion, continuing to contact people after they've asked you to stop.</li>
<li>Hate speech and bigotry (queerphobia, racism, colourism, antisemitism, xenophobia, sexism, ableism). </li>
<li>Cryptocurrency, NFTs, or other financial scams. </li>
<li>Advertising, spam. We also prohibit direct asks for aid or unsolicited demands to boost posts or links.</li>
<li>Federation and other mass follow bots, archiving bots. </li>
<li>Malicious links and phishing.</li>
<li>Untagged NSFW and violent content.</li>
<li>Crossposting boosts and replies to Twitter without user consent.</li>
<li>Being a dick to sex workers</li></ul>

<p>Moderation is at our discretion. Even if you haven't gone against any of the stated rules, we may still limit accounts or servers that are acting in bad faith, spreading harmful content, or otherwise causing problems. </p>

<h1>Federation policy</h1>

<p>We block instances that</p>

<ul><li>Have no active prohibition against hate speech and bigotry.</li>
<li>Carry content illegal in the UK or Germany</li></ul>

<p>We will also defederate with servers with users who continually go against our core rules. Like the basic rules, moderation of federation is also at our discretion and may occur for any reason.  </p>

637fa3bc9abb19f02c8c6ec9,billys.mom,False,12,"<h2>Privacy</h2>

<p>All social media platforms require some data storage, and Mastodon is no exception. However, with more people switching to Mastodon from Twitter, it&#39;s important to note some of the privacy concerns. The main concern is that private messages are stored. This is necessary to enable conversations, but it&#39;s important to recognize that the operators of the server, as well as any receiving server, may be able to view such messages. Additionally, recipients may screenshot, copy or otherwise share them. </p>

<p>As Mastodon&#39;s privacy policy indicates, there are some instances where privacy may be compromised. Some media outlets have used this as an argument against Mastodon, but the level of privacy depends on the instance you use. At billys.mom, we take privacy seriously and only read personal messages if they are reported by a user or if law enforcement issues a reasonable notice.</p>

<h3>Can I trust billys.mom?</h3>

<p>As with any Mastodon instance, we cannot guarantee 100% privacy. You should always be cautious about what you share on any website. However, we are committed to privacy and will not engage in voluntary surveillance programs. Moreover, governments cannot legally force services to implement blanket spying programs. </p>

<p>If you want to ensure a higher level of privacy, use PGP.</p>

<p>It is a means of exiting or avoiding the unpleasant odors emanating from the avian source.</p>

<p>I was a somewhat active user of Twitter from December 2008 until January 2023, but ultimately found that I was unable to fully enjoy the experience. Despite this, it is likely that I will continue to have some level of engagement on the platform.</p>

<p>Why this thing?</p>

<p>• Easy URL (and we all toot, amiright?!)<br>
• Federated with other servers who may have their own focus<br>
• Moderation that is controlled by the server operators<br>
• Distributed</p>

<p>It is true that Mastodon can be likened to a modern iteration of IRC (Internet Relay Chat), as it utilizes a distributed network of servers that employ hub-and-spoke architecture to facilitate communication among clients. The ability to implement per-server moderation (such as banning) is a feature inherent in the architecture of IRC, and channel-level moderation can be managed by individual channel owners. In the case of Mastodon, while the platform does not have a specific channel-level moderation configuration, the administrator of a particular instance (referred to as the &quot;site runner&quot;) has the capability to delegate moderation responsibilities to trusted users.</p>

637b2181ad72ace2dcf16329,kvlt.zone,False,2,"<h3>What kvlt.zone is</h3>

<p>kvlt.zone is a Mastodon instance inspired by music that falls somewhere in the overlap of metal, gothy shit, noise, dark ambient/dungeon synth, or anything reasonably adjacent to those things. Other things that drive it are horror movies, low budget sci fi/fantasy schlock, weird cinema in general, occult <strong>~ a e s t h e t i c ~</strong> nonsense, satanic #content, vulture culture, leather/kink, and existential bleakness. Despite the instance focus, we don’t take any of it too seriously. This place’s name is a joke and most of the posts are too.
<br><br>
Besides the thematically apt material, the limited user base may also post about goings-on in their lives.</p>

<h3>I don’t know what “kvlt” means, is that a meme</h3>

<p>kvlt is when you have an album that’s so authentically black metal you recorded it with a piece of barbed wire on a cassette tape that’s already been used twenty times, and you drank blood before every recording session, and your guitar track shreds eardrums and your vocal track sets Norwegian churches on fire.</p>

<h3>What’s the kvlt.zone stance on fascists in metal subcultures</h3>

<p>kvlt.zone is staunchly antifascist. We do not support unambiguously fascist artists, and our limited user base looks with scrutiny on artists whose content, branding, or press statements seem suspiciously fashy. Although we make every effort to vet our own tastes (which is trve kvlt), if you see something posted that seems to counter this statement, please give a heads up. It’s likely we’re just not aware of the artist(s)’s given issues, and we would rather not dwell in ignorance.</p>

<h3>Can I get some other content assurances for federating with you</h3>

<p>Our two users will endeavor not to say or do things that are bigoted, oppressive, or otherwise cruel toward anyone on the broader fedi. Bigotry means deliberate or inadvertent exhibitions of gross beliefs that uphold structural violence against systematically marginalized people. We are all taught some flavor of this shit, so mistakes are inevitable, but on kvlt.zone the aim is to NOT double down or give evasive non-apologies if someone points out a mistake.
<br><br>
We will make absolutely NO apologies for cops, bosses, landlords, billionaires, fascist organizations, or state violence.
<br><br>
We are not interested in starting or joining bad faith discussions, using human beings* as discursive punching bags, doxxing other human beings<em>, demanding that everyone shares our stances about whether sexual identity label A is the same as sexual identity label B, etc.
<br><br>
<em></em>For maximum clarity: cops, bosses, landlords, billionaires, fascists, and state operatives do not count as human beings.</em>
<br><br>
For the most part, do not expect hot takes or public “meta” posts. We will take meaningful private actions wherever applicable, but as an instance of this size, we recognize that very few people could (or should) give a shit about our opinions on interpersonal conflicts we aren’t directly involved in (or that they aren’t). We also keep our heads down usually. So you may find kvlt.zone rarely has an official public “stance” on any given fediverse issue, unless it seems like our specific voices are needed.
<br><br>
kvlt.zone can promise content warnings and/or hidden media for violence (especially gore), references to sexual assault, flashing images, porn or general nudity, kinky shit, and other things that could reasonably trigger PTSD episodes, seizures, etc., or get people in trouble at work. Other CWs are at user discretion.</p>

<h3>Can I join</h3>

<p>For now, no. That could change but we’d have to know you extremely well, maybe from offline. Both of us can moderate ourselves but that’s where the bandwidth stops, so better to avoid ugly surprises.</p>

<h3>Federation practices</h3>

<p>As a private instance, defederation is at the discretion of the two admin-users. We will defederate from instances known to be hotbeds for fascists, right-wing or neoliberal dickheads, libertarian “free speech” garbage, child porn, other material that strongly sexualizes minors, other material that’s just categorically vile (zoophilia, necrophilia, etc.), and anything else that falls in this ballpark. We also do not knowingly federate with Threads or any other Meta/Facebook-operated domain. This is not an exhaustive list of reasons we will defederate from an instance, it’s just the shit we find most worthy of defederation. If we haven’t taken action on a particular instance that you know meets the above criteria, it’s likely we just don’t know what’s up. Feel free to send an e-mail or submit a report.
<br><br>
Bear in mind that again, being a private instance we’re not particularly obligated to offer a reason for defederating.
<br><br>
Also bear in mind that an e-mail or report does not guarantee a response if your message appears to be in bad faith. Likewise please consider preemptively silencing kvlt.zone if you’re not interested in what we’re likely to post or if you disagree with the above policies. It’s free and legal to ignore us.</p>

<h2>Relay tjenester vi bruker</h2>

<p>Å bruke en eller flere relay tjenester kan være nyttig for mindre instanser for bedre federering, men vil også kreve mye ressurser og lagringsplass.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href=""https://relay.babb.be"">relay.babb.be</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href=""https://relay.mastodon.nu"">relay.mastodon.nu</a></strong></li>

</ul>

<h2>Tilpasninger</h2>

<p>Mikrobloggen bruker et tilpasset grensesnitt som skiller seg fra standard Mastodon, og vi har implementert en rekke tilpassede emojies som brukerne kan bruke.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href=""https://github.com/nileane/TangerineUI-for-Mastodon"">TangerineUI</a></strong></li>

<p>犯罪に加担していそうだったり、日本法に抵触するようなトゥートは禁止です。最悪警察や裁判所の要請に応じてログを開示することになります。</p>
<h4>2. CWやNSFWはちゃんと使ってください</h4>
<p>
誰かが不快になりそうだと思った文章を投稿したい時にはContent Warning(CW)を、画像にはNot Safe For Work(NSFW)タグを付けてください。たとえ付けていても日本法に抵触するような画像を投稿する行為は禁止です。<br>
とはいえ、正直なところ1人でも傷つく可能性がある投稿には全てCWを付けろと言ってもキリが無くなってしまいます。特にローカルTLや連合TLはたくさんの人の発言がほぼフィルタリングされずに流れてくるタイムラインです。それらのタイムラインを覗くときには不愉快な投稿が目に見えてしまう可能性があると言うことをある程度割り切ってください。

<h4>5. ローカルタイムラインで発言するときもなるべくメンションで</h4>

<p>
Mastodonはローカルタイムラインを使ってまるでインスタンス全員参加のチャットのように話ができますが、常に全員がログイン状態でない以上割込みや予期しないトゥートなどで会話がとぎれることも多いです。ローカルタイムラインで発言するときも、なるべくTwitterのようにメンションを基準にして話をすることをお勧めします。
</p>

<h4>6. みんな仲良く</h4>

<p>
ブロックとかミュートとかあるからね、絶対に仲良くできなさそうな人がいたら突っかかる前に距離を取ろうね。ブロックしました報告とかもトラブルの元になるだけだからやめようね。<br>

<h2>Rules</h2>

<p><em>We acknowledge that rules will never be comprehensive or cover every possible situation. Our instance rules are meant to be respected closely in cases that they do cover and to inform how we act in cases where they aren&#39;t explicit.

<ul>
<li>harassment, both individual and coordinated</li>
<li>insults and derogatory language</li>

<li>threats</li>

<ul>

<p>This rule does not apply to the citing of popular media, for example a screenshot or GIF from a movie, or things like memes.</p>

637b215ead72ace2dcf16295,majak.de,False,3,"<p><em><h1>Was ist &quot;Mastodon&quot; und der Zweck dieses Servers</h1></em>
Mastodon ist ein Verbund aus unabhängigen und freien Servern, welche den Nutzern eine Microblogging-Plattform bieten, die im Grunde Twitter sehr ähnlich ist.<br>
Ein Posting, hier &quot;Toot&quot; oder &quot;Tröt&quot; genannt, kann maximal 500 Zeichen und bis zu 4 Medien (Bilder, Videos) beinhalten.
<br><br>
Hierbei können die Nutzer anderen Nutzern folgen, kommentieren (Reply) oder die Posts (Toots) teilen (&quot;boosten&quot;). Auch private Nachrichten zwischen den Nutzern sind möglich.<br><br></p>

<p><em><h1>Wer kann mitmachen?</h1></em>
Mitmachen kann jeder - die Registrierung auf diesem Server ist aber primär für Familienmitglieder, Freunde und Freunde von Freunden gedacht. Bei der <a href=""https://majak.de/auth/sign_up"">Registrierung</a> wird im Feld &quot;Warum möchtest Du beitreten&quot; daher um eine kurze Vorstellung gebeten, die verifiziert wird, bevor Du freigeschaltet wirst. Die bestehenden Nutzer dieses Servers können alternativ auch direkte Einladungslinks verschicken.<br><br></p>

<p>Im weitesten Sinne aber kann <em>jeder</em> die Posts teilen und kommentieren. Besucher sind herzlich willkommen! Es gibt eine Vielzahl von öffentlichen Mastodon-Servern, wo sich jeder registrieren kann. Für eine Auswahl <a href=""https://joinmastodon.org"">schaut bitte hier</a>.<br><br></p>

<p><em><h1>Konzept und Bedienung</h1></em>
Die Plattform hat eine extreme Ähnlichkeit mit Twitter und ist sehr leicht zu bedienen. Wer auf Twitter aktiv ist, sollte sich sofort auskennen.<br>
Jeder, der sich registriert, kann jedem Anderen hier &quot;folgen&quot;, kann alles kommentieren und eigene Posts (hier &quot;Toot&quot; oder &quot;Tröt&quot; genannt) verfassen.<br>
Mit der weltweit eindeutigen Mastodon-Kennung &quot;@username@majak.de&quot; könnt Ihr sofort am weltweiten Mastodon-Netzwerk teilnehmen.<br>
Einfach heißt auch: Keine Formatierung, keine Schriftarten, kein komplizierter Editor. Maximal 500 Zeichen und 4 Anhänge (Bilder, Videos) pro Post. Hashtags sind ausdrücklich erwünscht. Links ebenfalls, diese werden als Vorschau dargstellt. Also quasi: Schreiben, absenden und fertig.<br>
Und obwohl sich die Seite auch auf dem Handybrowser extrem gut bedienen lässt, gibt es hervorragende Apps für Android und IOS, welche Euch auf Wunsch auch eine Nachricht schicken, wenn es in Eurem Dunstkreis etwas Neues gibt. Eine Auswahl <a href=""https://joinmastodon.org/apps"">ist hier zu finden</a>. (Ich persönlich mag &quot;Toot!&quot; für IOS ... kostet zwar und ist aktuell nur in englischer App-Sprache ... ich finde die App aber wirklich Klasse)<br><br></p>

<p><em><h1>Habe ich dann eine Art Homepage?</h1></em>
Im eigentlichen Sinne - ja. Unter &quot;https://majak.de/@username&quot; ist Dein öffentliches Profil, mit Deinem Profil- und Titelbild und allen &quot;Toots&quot; (Postings), die Du öffentlich verfasst hast. Und den dazugehörigen Kommentaren, sofern es welche gibt.<br>
Hier kannst Du also Deine Gedanken und Bilder in die Welt tragen, ohne Angst haben zu müssen, dass diese zweckentfremdet werden oder für &quot;wer-weiss-was&quot; verwendet werden.<br><br></p>

<p><em><h1>Wieso gibt es diesen Server?</h1></em>
Eigentlich lag auf &quot;majak.de&quot; mal meine Homepage. Aber alle paar Wochen mal einen Artikel schreiben, da fragt man sich dann schon mal: Worüber und warum. Ein Dreizeiler auf einer Homepage sieht armselig aus, für lange Artikel reicht die Zeit nicht - und so endete es mit einer verwaisten Homepage.<br><br>
Das Konzept von Twitter ist eigentlich sehr gut: Man teilt News und verfasst lieber kleine Beiträge - dafür öfter, schickt mal eben ein Bild in die Welt - und das ganz unkompliziert auch vom Handy aus.<br><br>
Jetzt kommt das &quot;Aber&quot;: Ich mag die zentralisierten Dienste wie Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc. immer weniger. Meine Fotos werden irgendwo gespeichert, gescannt, bewertet ... und gehören irgendwie nicht mir. Genausowenig wie meine Gedanken. Und damit nicht genug: Man wird zwischen den Beiträgen immer mehr mit doofer Werbung zugeballert. Von irgendwas müssen die ja leben: Meine Daten, Gedanken und Fotos für den Profit der Konzerne und personalisierte Werbung an jeder Ecke. &quot;1984&quot; war Kindergarten dagegen.<br><br>
Die sich entwickelnde Parallelwelt ist ein geniales Konzept: Menschen, die ihre Zeit und Ideen dafür opfern, hierzu eine Alternative zu schaffen. Open-Source und &quot;kostenlos&quot;, als Entwicklung der Gemeinschaft und nur von Spenden lebend.<br>
Plattformen, die von normalen Leuten auf ihren Servern betrieben werden, die Daten nur auf beteiligten Servern vorgehalten. Kein Tracking, keine Werbung. Und trotzdem kann jeder mit jedem interagieren - auch wenn der Andere einen ganz anderen Server nutzt.<br><br>
Seit 2 Jahren kommunizieren wir familienintern und darüber hinaus mit <a href=""https://matrix.org"">Matrix/Riot</a> als sichere, verschlüsselte Alternative zu WhatsApp und Co. Inzwischen nutzt sogar die französische Regierung diese Lösung für die interne Kommunikation.<br>
Nun gibt es Mastodon als dezentrale Twitter-Alternative, die auf eigenen Servern betrieben werden kann, und die zudem eine ideale &quot;Microblogging-Homepage&quot; für die Nutzer eines Servers ist. Mit Pixelfed steht eine Instagram-Alternative in den Startlöchern - die allerdings meiner Einschätzung nach noch ca. 6 Monate &quot;reifen&quot; muss ... welche ich mir dann allerdings ebenfalls genauer ansehe. Es bleibt also spannend!<br><br> </p>

<p><em><h1>Schlußwort und Datenschutz</h1></em>
Wir stehen für den demokratischen Grundgedanken der freien Meinungsäußerung, daher darf jeder seine Meinung auf seinem Account frei kund tun. Jedes Mitglied unserer Instanz darf seinen Account natürlich uneingeschränkt im weltweiten Mastodon-Netzwerk nutzen, so wie er es auch mit seinem persönlichen Facebook- oder Twitter-Account darf.<br><br></p>

<p>Keinen Spaß verstehen wir bei allerdings bei gesetzeswidriger Verwendung, welche eine dauerhafte Sperre nach sich zieht!<br><br></p>

<p><em>Wenn Ihr hierzu noch Fragen habt</em>, könnt ihr diese gerne auch persönlich per eMail an mich stellen. Ansonsten sehen wir uns hoffentlich hier :)<br><br></p>

<p><em><h1>Mastodon-Twitter-Bridge</h1></em>
Wer (noch oder absichtlich) beide Welten nutzt - Mastodon und Twitter: Für die Nutzer meiner Server steht unter <a href=""https://tootbridge.majak.de"">https://tootbridge.majak.de</a> ein Crossposter bereit, welcher Eure Mastodon-Toots auf Wunsch twittert und Eure Tweets auf Eurem Mastodon-Account trötet.

<p>Jeder ist eingeladen hier ein Profil zu eröffnen, die Regeln des Servers unterscheiden sich nicht großartig von denen anderer, bekannter Instanzen! Die Registrierung erfordert meine Zustimmung in erster Linie um Bots etc. abzuhalten.</p>

<h1>Nutzungsbedingungen</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Diese Instanz läuft auf meinem privaten Hobby-Server, gehostet in einem Rechenzentrum von 1&amp;1. Es gibt daher keinerlei Anspruch auf Verfügbarkeit etc. Geplante Downtimes werde ich aber Ankündigen und nach Möglichkeit in Zeiten mit weniger Aktivität legen.</p></li>
<li><p>Ich mache ein regelmäßiges Backup des Servers auf eine NAS bei mir zuhause! Dort enthalten sind auch die Daten dieser Mastodon Instanz! </p></li>
<li><p>Auf dieser Instanz sind alle Nutzenden willkommen, egal welcher politischen, religiösen oder sexuellen Ausrichtung und geschlechtlicher Identität. Wenn ich aber den Eindruck habe, dass hier jemand beleidigend, diskriminierend oder schlicht nervtötend wird, behalte ich mir das Recht vor, auch ohne Ankündigung Accounts zu sanktionieren oder zu deaktivieren.</p></li>
<li><p>Ich gehe davon aus, dass alle Nutzende dieser Instanz in der Lage sind, sich selbst gegenüber anderen zur Wehr zu setzen und Querelen unter einander zu klären. Die Meinungsfreiheit erlaubt auch hitzige Debatten. Werden Grenzen überschritten, gilt jedoch Ziffer 3.</p></li>

63cb5ec1bdcaf208a68219bc,legaltech.social,False,4,"<p><strong>What is a Mastodon decentralized network? Who can I talk to on legaltech.social?</strong></p>

<p>Those who are familiar with Twitter might wonder why they have to select a Mastodon server or instance. Mastodon is a decentralized social network, with thousands of servers connecting together rather than one organization hosting it. A Mastodon server can operate as an independent social network. People can use this platform to sign up, post messages, upload photos, and communicate with one another - just like on a normal website. A Mastodon social network is different from traditional websites because its users can message or mention each other regardless of the platform they are on; like sending an email between Gmail, Outlook, Fastmail, or Protonmail as long as you have the address.</p>

<p><strong>How to Get Started on Legaltech.social</strong></p>

<p>Foremost, it&#39;s a digital community. This social network service contains no advertising, monitoring, or money-making initiatives. This is a place shaped by members who wanted to escape the rage-driven onslaught of trolls and misinformation that define social media. A place built around connection and respectful conversation. Want to learn more? Here&#39;s this massive list of resources related to the <a href=""https://medium.com/@mastodonmigration/sharing-advice-and-assisting-with-the-great-mastodon-migration-53c1a286b805"">MastodonMigration</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Mastodon Server Covenant</strong> </p>

<p>We do our best to follow the <a href=""https://joinmastodon.org/covenant"">Mastodon Server Covenant</a> which is a set of minimalistic guidelines to provide the best possible experience for our users.  Account signups require manual approval to prevent bot and spam accounts. We attempt to review all signups within 24 hours.</p>

<h3>Code of Conduct</h3>

<p>Legaltech.social aims to be an informative community of marketers and attorneys, sharing insights and helping each other. We promote robust dialogue from all viewpoints, but want to cultivate a trusted instance for others to join. You are welcome to join!</p>

<p><strong>Basic rules:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Be polite and kind. Don&#39;t be a jerk. Religious speech, hate speech, discrimination, and harassment of any kind is not tolerated on this server. we will moderate threats of violence, harassment, harmful disinformation, hate speech, and similar content.</li>
<li>Be respectful - even if you disagree.</li>
<li>No spam or commercial advertisements. This includes excessive commercial advertising, promotional campaigns, and negative SEO.</li>
<li>Mark sensitive content with a content warning.</li>
<li>No harassment, dogpiling or doxxing of other users.</li>
</ul>

<p>This server is intended for anyone who works in the field of law firm marketing. The primary instance language for this server is English. Play nicely and be respectful! And everything will be fine.</p>

<p><strong>Best practices:</strong> </p>

<p>The list below is a collection of behavior expected from Legaltech.social users. If you see a user go against these best practices in a way that bothers you, please file a report and the moderators will talk to them. While these best practices are designed to be guidelines for a good communal instance, repeated malicious unwillingness to follow the best practices will be considered just like breaking a rule. These provisions notwithstanding, the administration of the service reserves the right to revoke any user’s access permissions, at any time, for any reason, except as limited by law.
 The following rules are a (non-exhaustive) list of behaviors and type of content that may lead to deletion of toots, silencing or suspension of accounts, at the discretion of the instance administrators, as described in the legaltech.online terms.</p>

<ul>
<li>Aggregating, posting, and/or disseminating a person&#39;s demographic, personal, or private data without express permission (informally called doxing or dropping dox) may be considered harassment.</li>
