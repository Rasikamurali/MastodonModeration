If they do, it’s an easy path from there to very simply discrediting *all* her ideas. So, of course, cis women learn very quickly to either just never express ideas or get very good at bottling their emotions. </p><p>Trans women may not always be as experienced at this, and uniquely to trans women, this leads to accusations of “male socialisation”, a feminism washed way of accusing trans women of being men. </p><p>(many folks have tried to tell me it has some legitimate uses but, I am not convinced and you probably won’t convince me either)</p><p>So, we have this wonderful way of being both *transphobic* *misgendering* and *misogynistic* to specifically trans women at the same time- with the neat excuse that a “real woman” would have learned her place  by now. all while telling ourselves we are being progressive and feminist while upholding patriarchy against all genders</p>",2023-10-19 23:48:38+00:00,[],[],0,0

Their refresh system is great, their signal is pretty decent (when it works, the masts in my area though are made of crisp packets), and I’ve only ever had one major issue with them in the ~12 years I’ve been with them.</p><p>But their pricing SUCKS.</p><p>In 2021 I got an iPhone 13 Pro Max in sierra blue. The airtime for that was £30 a month for 30GB, doubled to 60GB for free with Volt. Cool. I now have a 15 Pro Max through Apple themselves but I passed the 13 on to my mum, who’s finishing off paying the final year (she needed to upgrade from an iPhone X and £300 (the amount remaining on the 3 year phone plan) for a mint condition 13PM is a fucking steal, so she’s happy with that).</p><p>Here’s the problem. On the same bill, my mum has 75GB, doubled to 150GB, and pays £18 a month SIM only.</p><p>Giffgaff will give you <strong>UNLIMITED</strong> data for £30 a month, or 40GB for £10 a month.</p><p>EE, who I fucking despise, is doing half price deals on unlimited and 150GB plans at the moment, but full price they’re £30 and £26 respectively. You can even share data around, which you used to be able to do with o2, but can’t anymore.</p><p>It’s absolutely absurd. The main issue is that AFAIK my number is the primary number for the account. I can’t really move elsewhere. And as someone who pays for their phone bill now…this sucks.</p><p>I need to consider what my options are going forward as £30 a month for 30GB (again, doubled for free) is pitiful.</p><p>Volt: Virgin Media and O2’s deal where if you have services from both, you get your internet doubled on both sides, among some other neat benefits.</p><p>EE hate: When my mum moved to O2 a few years ago they fucked up the billing on her account and started charging her for this little mini router thing they added for free (basically they couldn’t add the discount to the router plan so added it to her phone plan, when that was cancelled the discount went with it). I had to complain on Twitter for them to stop threatening her with payment requests and <strong>the fucking debt collectors</strong>, which she already was forced to send money to the first time around.

Did I know this book would be about time travel initially? No. I wanted to read it because it's a mystery/thriller. But as soon as Jen woke up on Day Minus One, then Day Minus Two, I knew. At first, I was confused by the frequent time skips and didn't understand why they were so random, but after learning that they may be happening so that Jen can pay more attention to the details of her surroundings and interactions, it made more sense.

There's been a few posts recently with a certain... lack of chill about transition timeframes.</p><p>Like, where did this assumption that we should be ""basically done"" within three years come from? Also, if you're equating bottom surgery (or any other key surgery) with done-ness, that's pretty alienating for those of us without that as a goal. Makes us feel like you secretly view us as incomplete. I know you don't mean it that way, but still, ow.</p><p>In fact, the more I think about it, the less I like ""transition"" as a concept at all. I began hormones nearly two years ago, and I'll be on them indefinitely. My body's changing and will never stop changing. And I'll keep learning new things about how to dress and act and present myself forever. That's not a transition between two stable states, it's the beginning of the rest of my life.</p><p>Will I get surgeries of any sort? I haven't decided yet. I really don't want to rush or be rushed into decisions like that. No judgment of anyone who *does* know exactly what they want already; I totally respect that.</p><p>Are my changes ""on track"" compared to others? Are my boobs big enough, face fem enough, makeup skills developed enough, confidence strong enough? I can't help but compare myself in the back of my mind, but that way lies madness. I'm not any of you, I'm me. I'll get where I get when I get there. And it'll be beautiful no matter how long it takes.</p><p>My journey is not without its bumps, but every time I look back months or years or decades, I'm stunned by how far I've come. I don't need to rush that, only enjoy it and be proud of myself. And I'm proud of all of you too-- those rushing full steam ahead, those stumbling and frustrated with your lack of progress, those still intimidated and daring yourselves to begin.</p><p>Love you all. ❤️ :heart_trans:</p>",2023-10-20 09:28:00+00:00,[],"[{'name': 'transfem', 'url': 'https://genomic.social/tags/transfem'}]",0,0
