<h1>Analyzing Content Moderation on Mastodon</h1>
<h2>Independent Study under Professor YY Ahn</h2>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>This paper presents a comprehensive examina-
tion of moderation policies within the decentralized social
media platform, Mastodon, with a specific focus on evaluating
the applicability of Dunbar’s number to online communities.
Mastodon, renowned for its federated structure, offers a unique
environment for exploring how moderation strategies evolve
across varying instance sizes. Leveraging data from diverse
instances, ranging from small, intimate communities to larger,
more populous ones, we employ a mixed-methods approach to
characterize moderation practices.
Drawing upon qualitative analysis of instance-specific rules
and regulations, as well as quantitative metrics such as []
on policies. By examining whether instances adhere to the
theoretical constraints of Dunbar’s number – the cognitive limit
on stable social relationships – we aim to elucidate whether
smaller communities exhibit qualitatively different moderation
approaches compared to larger ones.</p>
