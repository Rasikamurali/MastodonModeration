# Analyzing Content Moderation on Mastodon

This project aims to analyze the moderation policies on Mastodon. Mastodon rose to fame as a platform in October 2022. Mastodon is different compared to other platforms owing to it's federated structure and community modertaion.
We aim to study if those differences in structure have made a difference to how moderation functions.

## Current Status

We collected streaming data from Mastodon in October 2023, exactly a year after it rose to fame, thanks to Elon Musk's Twitter takeover.
We have collected all the instances and it policies to analyze commonalities across the rules on Mastodon.
Further, we are analyzing the rules and description across the content of the instance to observe patterns.
We aim to able to identify telling signals for moderation next.
